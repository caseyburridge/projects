Huoxiang Drink (HD), derived from traditional Chinese medicine, has been reported to effectively treat digestive disorders caused by external cold and internal dampness. However, the pharmaceutical targets and mechanisms for HD against IBS remain unclear. Data mining, bioinformatics analysis, and network pharmacology were employed to explore the potential pharmacological mechanisms of HD against IBS. In this study, we screened 50 core targets to investigate the pharmacological mechanisms of HD against IBS. Enrichment analysis revealed that HD may participate in various signaling pathways, especially the inflammation-related tumor necrosis factor, signaling pathway and hypoxia-inducible factor signaling pathway. Molecular docking results confirmed that MOL000098 (Quercetin), MOL000006 (Luteolin), MOL005828 (Nobiletin), MOL005916 (Irisolidone), and MOL004328 (Naringenin), as key active ingredients in HD, bound to core targets (tumor protein P53, tumor necrosis factor, matrix metalloproteinases 9, and vascular endothelial growth factor-A) for topical treatment of IBS. This study suggested that HD offered a potential therapeutic strategy against IBS. Our findings may facilitate the efficient screening of active ingredients in HD and provide a theoretical basis for further validating the clinical therapeutic effects of HD on treating IBS.","Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Network Pharmacology, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A, Molecular Docking Simulation, Data Mining, Tumor Necrosis Factors, Drugs, Chinese Herbal, Medicine, Chinese Traditional","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Drugs, Chinese Herbal"", ""value"": ""Drugs, Chinese Herbal"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",2023-Sep-29,"Ruo-Hui Wang, Yi-Ke Lin, Hong-Kai Xie, Hui Li, Mu Li, Dong He",Medicine,2023,Journal Article,"

The SymMap database was used to search herbal medicines for the target protein. The target gene of IBS gave rise to the common gene protein which is the potential target of SLBZP in IBS therapy. The interactions between target proteins were analyzed in a STRING database, the protein relationship network was analyzed using Cytoscape software, and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis of the core target gene group was carried out in a DAVID database in order to construct the ""compound-traditional Chinese medicine/molecule-target-pathway"" network.

A water extract of Berberis heteropoda Schrenk root (BHS) inhibited the growth of S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. faecalis. BHS potentially damaged the structure of the bacterial cell membrane and decreased the activity of some membranous enzymes, eventually killing the S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. faecalis bacteria. Oral administration of BHS (low, middle and high dose group, L, M and H) significantly alleviated the abdominal pain, diarrhea, and depression-like symptoms of D-IBS rats, and the efficacy index ranged from 30% to 60%, indicating that the BHS treatment was effective. BHS (L, M and H) alleviated the abnormal pathological changes in the brain, as evidenced by HE staining. The expression of CHAT, 5-HT, C-FOS and CGRP was reduced by the BHS treatment (L, M and H). Our findings provide novel insights into the use of the natural product BHS to inhibit pathogenic bacteria by destroying the bacterial structure, indicating that BHS possesses certain biological activities.

Currently, there is no evidence of obvious anatomic or physiologic abnormalities on the routine diagnostic examinations. There are multiple pathological factors involved in IBS responsible for its heterogeneous nature, although the exact etiology and pathology of IBS are not well known and it is disappointed to develop biomarkers for this disorder. These factors including low-grade inflammation, activation of immune system, changed intestinal microorganism, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), malabsorption of bile acid (BA), increased number of mast cells (MCs). Current pharmacologic treatment for IBS focuses on alleviation of its symptoms, but not on the elimination of its cause. Although there are a lot of conventional chemical medicines for IBS available, due to the limited clinical benefits, high medical expenses and severe side effects, many IBS patients have turned to alternative medicine, particularly Chinese herbal medicine (CHM). Chinese herbal therapies have been used for thousand years in eastern Asia and have been provided that they are effective in relieving symptoms among IBS patients. Generally, traditional Chinese herbal formulae (CHF) consisting of CHM can be easily adjusted in accordance with concrete conditions, which means the treatment is based on syndrome differentiation and varied from individual to individual.

The pathophysiology, etiology and pathogenesis of IBS are poorly understood, with no evidence of inflammatory, anatomic, metabolic, or neoplastic factors to explain the symptoms. Treatment approaches are mainly focused on symptom management to maintain everyday functioning and to improve quality of life for patients with IBS. However, prescribed medications often result in significant side effects, and many IBS sufferers (particularly Chinese) do not improve. Instead of taking a variety of conventional medications, many have turned to taking traditional Chinese medicine or integrated Chinese and Western medicine for remedy. A number of clinical trials have shown that Chinese herbal, acupuncture or integrative therapies presented improved treatment outcomes and reduced side effects in IBS patients. The purpose of this review article is to examine the treatment approaches of IBS that have been published in recent years, especially in China, to assess the possible differences in treating IBS between China and other countries.

In this review, firstly, we present the etiology and therapy of IBS in terms of traditional Chinese medical theory. Secondly, we summarize the clinical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of TCM formulas for IBS patients that are available in the literature (from 1998 to September 2013), in which 14 RCTs conducted of high quality were discussed in detail. Of the 14 selected trials, 12 of those concluded that TCM formulas provided superior improvement in the global symptoms of IBS patients over the placebo or conventional medicines. As well, all 14 RCTs suggested that TCM formulas have good safety and tolerability. Last but not least, we explore the pharmacological mechanisms of the anti-IBS TCM formulas available in the literature (from 1994 to September, 2013). Collectively, in combating IBS symptoms, most TCM formulas exert multi-targeting actions including the regulation of neurotransmitters and hormones in the enteric nervous system (ENS), modulation of smooth muscle motility in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, attenuation of intestinal inflammation and restoration of intestinal flora, etc. In conclusion, TCM formulas appear to be promising for IBS treatment.

However, there still lack the reasonable and all-round analytical approach and the scientific studies on its underlying mechanisms. Therefore, our study aimed to develop the novel method for evaluating its quality as well as to interpret the potential mechanisms. In our study, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprint was applied to provide a chemical profile of KT. The neonatal maternal separation (NMS) on Sprague-Dawley pups was employed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of KT by virtue of various parameters including visceral hyperalgesia, serum nitric oxide (NO) level, and tissue 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) level. Consequently, a chromatographic condition, which was carried at 30¬∞C with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min on AQUA 3Œº C18 column with mobile phase of acetonitrile and water-phosphoric acid (100:0.1, v/v), was established to give a common fingerprint chromatography under 254 nm with a similarity index of 0.963 within ten batches of KT samples. On the NMS model, KT markedly elevated the pain threshold of NMS rats. Furthermore, KT at three doses significantly decreased 5-HT content from distal colon of visceral hyperalgesia rats induced by NMS, while the significant decrease of 5-HT content in serum was only observed in the group with KT at high dose. However, compared with that in NMS rats without KT, there was no apparent difference of 5-HT level from brain issue in the rats with various doses. Besides, KT could substantially elevate the concentration of NO in the serum. The results showed our study developed the simple, rapid, accurate, reproducible qualitative and quantitative analysis by HPLC fingerprint for the quality control for KT. Data from the pharmacological investigation suggested that the curative effect of KT to the visceral hypersensitivity may be concerned with the level of 5-HT and NO in vivo, promising its potential in irritable bowel syndrome treatment.","Animals, Animals, Newborn, Brain, Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid, Colon, Disease Models, Animal, Drug Evaluation, Preclinical, Drugs, Chinese Herbal, Female, Hyperalgesia, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Maternal Deprivation, Nitric Oxide, Phytotherapy, Rats, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, Serotonin","[{""label"": ""Colon"", ""value"": ""Colon"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Drugs, Chinese Herbal"", ""value"": ""Drugs, Chinese Herbal"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",2013-Feb-15,"Yun-Long Chen, Xiao-Qi Huang, Shi-Jie Xu, Jin-Bin Liao, Ru-Jun Wang, Xiao-Feng Lu, You-Liang Xie, Fu-Sheng Zhou, Zi-Ren Su, Xiao-Ping Lai",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2013,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","

Patients need proper assessment and explanation of IBS pathophysiology and appropriate therapies. A low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) diet effectively reduces symptoms in 75% of patients. Best treatment for those nonresponsive will depend on the pathophysiological basis for symptom genesis, with the following possible abnormalities: (i) Visceral hypersensitivity and/or enhanced gut-brain communication: a low FODMAP diet is mainly targeted for this patient group. A dietitian may also recommend antispasmodic agents, including peppermint oil. Another dietary treatment is a low food chemical diet, although this diet is often extremely limited, and therefore, not suited for some populations. Psychological therapies are also clinically beneficial. (ii) Altered motility: in patients with fast transit, a dietitian may recommend a reduction in all FODMAPs or targeted monosaccharides and disaccharides, which are more osmotic in nature. If not effective, patients may benefit from psyllium, which has an exceptional water-holding capacity aimed to promote more formed stools. Patients with slow or uncoordinated transit are often more difficult to treat. Dietary interventions have some success and usually comprise a combination of adequate fiber and fluid, osmotic laxatives, and stimulating agents such as caffeine, senna, and exercise. (iii) Altered microbiome: supplementary probiotics and prebiotics have weak evidence of efficacy with some notable exceptions. A dietitian may trial supplementary Bifidobacterium infantis or oligosaccharides, usually as an adjunct therapy.

Pinaverium and peppermint essential oil have the best-documented efficacy and only moderate adverse effects. Antispasmodics with marked atropinic effects do not have a favourable risk-benefit balance; (4) Tricylic antidepressants seem to have only modest analgesic effects in this setting. In contrast, their adverse effects are frequent and they have somewhat negative risk-benefit balances.

Osmotic laxatives are effective on constipation. Symptomatic treatments for constipation can sometimes aggravate abdominal discomfort; (7) Loperamide has been poorly assessed in patients with recurrent irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea. It modestly slows bowel movement but does not relieve pain or abdominal discomfort; (8) Dietary measures have not been tested in comparative trials.

Coffee is a widely consumed beverage with numerous bioactive compounds that have potential effects on human health and disease states. Current studies on the effect of regular coffee consumption on the risk of developing IBS symptoms have yielded conflicting results. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine whether coffee intake is associated with developing IBS. A systematic literature search was performed in three electronic databases, namely PubMed, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library, from inception until 31 March 2023. All original studies reporting associations between coffee intake and IBS were considered for inclusion. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for each study, and estimates were pooled, and where appropriate, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and <i>p</i>-values were calculated. Eight studies comprising 432,022 patients were included in the final meta-analysis. Using a fixed-effects model, coffee drinkers (any intake) had a reduced likelihood of developing IBS compared to controls, with a pooled OR of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.80 to 0.84). Sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of the estimates.

However, clinical treatment of irritable bowel disease with vitamin D is controversial. Objective: we conducted a meta-analysis of all clinical trials to evaluate the associations between vitamin D and irritable bowel disease. Methods: we screened all randomized controlled trials that were published before December 20, 2021 from the following databases: Medline, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Cochrane Central, and Clinical Trial. We used RevMan 5.4.1 and Stata 16.1 to analyze the relevant data. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) was used to report effect sizes. Serum vitamin D concentration, risk of vitamin D deficiency among patients with IBS, Symptom Severity Score (SSS), and Quality of Life (QoL) score are the main endpoint outcomes in this study. Results: data from twelve clinical trials with 1331 IBS patients were included. Patients with IBS have relatively low vitamin D levels in their serum.

Yet, full understanding of its etiology and optimal treatment remains elusive. Understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of IBS has been limited. However, research is beginning to identify the cause as multifactorial (e.g., low-grade local mucosal inflammation, systemic immune activation, altered intestinal permeability, intestinal hypersensitivity, altered central nervous system processing, changes in intestinal microbiota). Understanding of the role of vitamin D in intestinal inflammation, immunity, and gastrointestinal conditions is increasing but is not yet fully understood. Growing evidence has linked vitamin D deficiency with a variety of gastrointestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, colorectal cancer, and IBS. Several studies have demonstrated that individuals with IBS are more likely to have vitamin D deficiency than healthy controls. Recent vitamin D supplementation studies have shown improvement in quality of life and reduction in IBS symptoms (including abdominal pain, distention, flatulence, constipation, and visceral sensitivity) but the mechanism remains unclear. Nurses are well positioned to educate patients about the importance of sufficient vitamin D for overall health in individuals with IBS as well as participate in well-designed therapeutic studies to explore whether enhanced vitamin D status will ultimately help treat IBS more effectively.","Abdominal Pain, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Quality of Life, Vitamin D","[{""label"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""value"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Quality of Life"", ""value"": ""Quality of Life"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Abdominal Pain"", ""value"": ""Abdominal Pain"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Vitamin D"", ""value"": ""Vitamin D"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"Sarah W Matthews, Margaret M Heitkemper, Kendra Kamp",Gastroenterology nursing : the official journal of the Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates,None provided,Journal Article,"

Among various approaches to supportive therapy that aims to improve mental health in affected individuals, vitamin D supplementation is considered to be an effective method which may also be beneficial in alleviating the symptoms during the course of IBDs and IBS. The aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature presenting the data regarding the influence of vitamin D supplementation on mental health in adults with inflammatory and functional bowel diseases, including IBDs and IBS. This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database (Registration number CRD42020155779). A systematic search of the PubMed and Web of Science databases was performed, and the intervention studies published until September 2021 were included. The human studies eligible to be included in the review should have described any intervention involving vitamin D as a supplement in a group of adult patients suffering from IBDs and/or IBS and should have assessed any component of mental health, but studies presenting the effects of combined supplementation of multiple nutrients were excluded. After eliminating the duplicates, a total of 8514 records were screened and assessed independently by two researchers. Further evaluation was carried out on the basis of title, abstract, and full text. Finally, 10 studies (four for IBDs and six for IBS) were selected for the current systematic review, and their quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The studies analyzed the influence of various doses of vitamin D on bowel diseases, compared the results of vitamin D supplementation with placebo, or administered specific doses of vitamin D to obtain the required level in the blood. Supplementation was performed for at least 6 weeks. The analyzed mental health outcomes mainly included disease-specific quality of life/quality of life, anxiety, and depression. The majority of studies (including high-quality ones) confirmed the positive effect of vitamin D supplementation on the mental health of IBD and IBS patients, which was proven by all research works evaluating anxiety and depression and by the majority of research works evaluating quality of life. Although the studies followed different dosage regimens and supplementation protocols, the positive influence of vitamin D on mental health was found to be consistent. The number of studies on patients suffering from ulcerative colitis and the availability of trials randomized against the placebo group was low in the current review, which is considered to be a limitation of the present study and could also reflect the final outcome of the analysis. The conducted systematic review established the positive effect of vitamin D supplementation on the mental health of IBD and IBS patients, but this result requires further investigation, particularly in relation to other mental health outcomes.","Dietary Supplements, Humans, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Mental Health, Vitamin D","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Vitamin D"", ""value"": ""Vitamin D"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",2021-Oct-19,"Dominika G≈ÇƒÖbska, Aleksandra Ko≈Çota, Katarzyna Lachowicz, Dominika Skolmowska, Ma≈Çgorzata Stacho≈Ñ, Dominika Guzek",Nutrients,2021,"Journal Article, Systematic Review","

Increasing dietary fiber intake can improve bowel movements. <b>The aim</b> of the study was to assess the efficacy of a non-alcoholic fermented pasteurized kombucha drink enriched with inulin and vitamins in patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). <b>Material and methods</b>. The study (NCT05164861) was approved by Local Ethics Committee and enrolled subjects with IBS (according to ROME IV). The subjects were randomized to receive either 220 ml of a non-alcoholic drink, based on pasteurized kombucha (KG), enriched with inulin (1.15 g/100 ml) or 220 ml water (control group, CG), for 10 days. Standard examination included evaluation of stool frequency (bowel movements per day), stool form (with the Bristol stool scale) and evaluation of concomitant symptoms (abdominal pain/discomfort, abdominal fullness, bloating, and feeling of incomplete bowel emptying) with the use of 5-point Likert scale before (BL) and 10 days after the start of intervention (EOT). Using visual analog scales (VAS), the palatability of the studied food was assessed at the beginning and end of the observation period. <b>Results</b>. Significant increase of stool frequency was found at the EOT compared to BL in KG (n=20), Mean¬±SD: 0.60¬±0.31 to 0.85¬±0.19 times/day; p=0.004, while there was no change in CG (n=20): 0.63¬±0.33 vs 0.72¬±0.28, p=0.6. Mean values of stool scale form increased in KG (3.0¬±1.2 to 4.4¬±1.0, p=0.001), while remained unchanged in CG (2.9¬±1.2 vs 3.4¬±1.2, p=0.6). Mean values of the Bristol stool scale in KG and CG differed significantly at EOT (p=0.018). Significant decrease in mean values of incomplete bowel emptying feeling was found in KG (1.88¬±0.78 at BL vs 1.41¬±0.56 points at EOT, p=0.015), but not in the control group. There were no statistically significant differences between patient's reports of the studied groups for other symptoms (bitterness and dryness in the mouth, heartburn, nausea, abdominal pain and heaviness in the stomach after eating). <b>Conclusion</b>.

This narrative review addresses data and concepts around the functional characteristics of fibre and subsequent physiological responses induced in patients with IBS with a view to exploring the application of such knowledge to the precision use of fibre supplements. The key findings are that first, individual fibres elicit highly distinct physiological responses that are associated with their functional characteristics rather than solubility. Second, the current evidence has focused on the use of fibres as a monotherapy for IBS symptoms overall without attempting to exploit these functional characteristics to elicit specific, symptom-targeted effects, or to use fibre types as adjunctive therapies. Personalisation of fibre therapies can therefore target several therapeutic goals. Proposed goals include achieving normalisation of bowel habit, modulation of gut microbiota function towards health and correction of microbial effects of other dietary therapies. To put into perspective, bulking fibres that are minimally fermented can offer utility in modulating indices of bowel habit; slowly fermented fibres may enhance the activities of the gut microbiota; and the combination of both fibres may potentially offer both benefits while optimising the activities of the microbiota throughout the different regions of the colon. In conclusion, understanding the GI responses to specific fibres, particularly in relation to the physiology of the individual, will be the future for personalising fibre therapy for enhancing the personalised management of patients with IBS.","Dietary Fiber, Dietary Supplements, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Precision Medicine","[{""label"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""value"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Fiber"", ""value"": ""Dietary Fiber"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"Daniel So, Peter R Gibson, Jane G Muir, Chu K Yao",Gut,2021,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review","

Symptom-based diagnosis of IBS is enhanced with additional history for symptoms of somatoform and psychological disorders and alarm symptoms, physical examination including digital rectal examination, and screening tests to exclude organic disease (by measuring hemoglobin and C-reactive protein concentrations). The initial treatment plan should include patient education, reassurance, and first-line treatments such as fiber and osmotic laxatives for constipation, opioids for diarrhea, antispasmodics for pain and for management of associated psychological disorders. For patients who do not respond to those IBS treatments, testing for specific functional disorders may be required in a minority of patients with IBS. These disorders include rectal evacuation disorder, abnormal colonic transit, and bile acid diarrhea.

The condition affects between 5% and 10% of otherwise healthy individuals at any one point in time and, in most people, runs a relapsing and remitting course. The best described risk factor is acute enteric infection, but irritable bowel syndrome is also more common in people with psychological comorbidity and in young adult women than in the rest of the general population. The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome is incompletely understood, but it is well established that there is disordered communication between the gut and the brain, leading to motility disturbances, visceral hypersensitivity, and altered CNS processing. Other less reproducible mechanisms might include genetic associations, alterations in gastrointestinal microbiota, and disturbances in mucosal and immune function. In most people, diagnosis can be made on the basis of clinical history with limited and judicious use of investigations, unless alarm symptoms such as weight loss or rectal bleeding are present, or there is a family history of inflammatory bowel disease or coeliac disease. Once the diagnosis is made, an empathetic approach is key and can improve quality of life and symptoms, and reduce health-care expenditure. The mainstays of treatment include patient education about the condition, dietary changes, soluble fibre, and antispasmodic drugs. Other treatments tend to be reserved for people with severe symptoms and include central neuromodulators, intestinal secretagogues, drugs acting on opioid or 5-HT receptors, or minimally absorbed antibiotics (all of which are selected according to predominant bowel habit), as well as psychological therapies. Increased understanding of the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome in the past 10 years has led to a healthy pipeline of novel drugs in development.","Abdominal Pain, Brain, Dietary Fiber, Gastrointestinal Agents, Gastrointestinal Diseases, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Quality of Life","[{""label"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""value"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Quality of Life"", ""value"": ""Quality of Life"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Abdominal Pain"", ""value"": ""Abdominal Pain"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Fiber"", ""value"": ""Dietary Fiber"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",2020-Nov-21,"Alexander C Ford, Ami D Sperber, Maura Corsetti, Michael Camilleri","Lancet (London, England)",2020,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review","

We included RCTs that compared any of these treatments with each other (head-to-head trials) or with placebo, in which the efficacy of soluble fibre, antispasmodic drugs, peppermint oil, or gut-brain neuromodulators was assessed in adults (aged at least 18 years) with IBS of any subtype after 4-12 weeks of treatment. Only RCTs reporting a dichotomous assessment of overall response to therapy, in terms of either improvement in global IBS symptoms or improvement in abdominal pain, were included. The efficacy and safety of all treatments were reported as a pooled relative risk (RR) with 95% CIs to summarise the effect of each comparison tested, and treatments were ranked according to their P-score.</p><p><b>FINDINGS</b>:<br>Our search identified 5863 references, of which 81 were screened for eligibility. 51 RCTs with data from 4644 patients were eligible for inclusion in our analysis, but only 13 of these trials were at low risk of bias.

The primary outcome was global improvement in IBS as measured by an IBS symptom severity score. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, abdominal pain, stool frequency, stool consistency, and adverse events. The overall certainty of the evidence supporting the primary and secondary outcomes was assessed using the GRADE criteria. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess risk of bias. We calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous outcomes and the risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes.</p><p><b>MAIN RESULTS</b>:<br>Four RCTs (307 participants) were included. Two studies compared clinical homeopathy (homeopathic remedy, asafoetida or asafoetida plus nux vomica) to placebo for IBS with constipation (IBS-C). One study compared individualised homeopathic treatment (consultation plus remedy) to usual care for the treatment of IBS in female patients. One study was a three armed RCT comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to supportive listening or usual care. The risk of bias in three studies (the two studies assessing clinical homeopathy and the study comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to usual care) was unclear on most criteria and high for selective reporting in one of the clinical homeopathy studies. The three armed study comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to usual care and supportive listening was at low risk of bias in four of the domains and high risk of bias in two (performance bias and detection bias).A meta-analysis of the studies assessing clinical homeopathy, (171 participants with IBS-C) was conducted. At short-term follow-up of two weeks, global improvement in symptoms was experienced by 73% (46/63) of asafoetida participants compared to 45% (30/66) of placebo participants (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.18; 2 studies, very low certainty evidence). In the other clinical homeopathy study at two weeks, 68% (13/19) of those in the asafoetida plus nux vomica arm and 52% (12/23) of those in the placebo arm experienced a global improvement in symptoms (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.15; very low certainty evidence). In the study comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to usual care (N = 20), the mean global improvement score (feeling unwell) at 12 weeks was 1.44 + 4.55 (n = 9) in the individualised homeopathic treatment arm compared to 1.41 + 1.97 (n=11) in the usual care arm (MD 0.03; 95% CI -3.16 to 3.22; very low certainty evidence).In the study comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to usual care, the mean IBS symptom severity score at 6 months was 210.44 + 112.4 (n = 16) in the individualised homeopathic treatment arm compared to 237.3 + 110.22 (n = 60) in the usual care arm (MD -26.86, 95% CI -88.59 to 34.87; low certainty evidence).

The effects of diet seem to be a result of an interaction with the gut bacteria and the gut endocrine cells. The density of gut endocrine cells is low in IBS patients, and it is believed that this abnormality is the direct cause of the symptoms seen in IBS patients. The low density of gut endocrine cells is probably caused by a low number of stem cells and low differentiation progeny toward endocrine cells. A low fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharide, and polyol (FODMAP) diet and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) restore the gut endocrine cells to the level of healthy subjects. It has been suggested that our diet acts as a prebiotic that favors the growth of a certain types of bacteria. Diet also acts as a substrate for gut bacteria fermentation, which results in several by-products. These by-products might act on the stem cells in such a way that the gut stem cells decrease, and consequently, endocrine cell numbers decrease. Changing to a low-FODMAP diet or changing the gut bacteria through FMT improves IBS symptoms and restores the density of endocrine cells.","Cell Differentiation, Diet, Diet, Carbohydrate-Restricted, Enteroendocrine Cells, Fecal Microbiota Transplantation, Fermentation, Gastrointestinal Hormones, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Monosaccharides, Polysaccharides, Prebiotics, Quality of Life, Stem Cells","[{""label"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""value"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Quality of Life"", ""value"": ""Quality of Life"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Fiber"", ""value"": ""Dietary Fiber"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",2019-Aug-07,"Magdy El-Salhy, Jan Gunnar Hatlebakk, Trygve Hausken",Nutrients,2019,"Journal Article, Review","

While the pathogenesis is not clearly understood, current research points to the role of the gut microbiome and alterations in the diversity of the microbiota. Probiotics, prebiotics, and low FODMAP diet are therapeutic means associated with modification of the gut microbiome for the alleviation of IBS symptoms. This narrative review assesses the current evidence on the efficacy of these treatment options based on findings from recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses published from October 2013 to October 2018. There is a general agreement in the 11 included systematic reviews and meta-analyses that probiotic therapy is safe and can be effective in improving overall IBS symptom scores and abdominal pain in the general IBS population. Nonetheless, conflicting findings remain and no recommendation on the specific species/strains or combination can be made. Short-term restriction of FODMAP in the diet can improve IBS symptoms as per the findings of 7 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, even though the quality of the evidence remains questionable. Inappropriate use of the low FODMAP diet can potentially impact health negatively. As such, a low FODMAP diet is only recommended as a second line treatment guided by qualified clinicians with specialized training. Despite preclinical studies of some prebiotics demonstrated the potential use in improving gut microbiome and intestinal inflammatory response, the beneficial effect of prebiotics for IBS remains theoretical.

The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) and the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) guidelines state that the evidence does not support the use of fiber supplements in the treatment of FC in children, and the Rome IV criteria do not recommend an increase in fiber consumption, in children with IBS. Despite this, in general practice, it is commonly recommended that children who experience constipation and IBS to increase their fiber intake. We conducted a systematic review of the available evidence on the role of fiber in the treatment of FC and IBS in children. Thirteen full-text articles with a total of seven hundred and twenty-three pediatric participants were included in this review. Three clinical trials found positive effects of dietary fiber for the management of IBS. Nine out of ten trials found fiber to be either more effective than placebo, or just as effective as laxative treatment. Most studies on the use of fiber for the treatment of FC and IBS have shown its benefit.

The best studied 'gluten intolerance' is coeliac disease, an auto-immune disease that affects the small intestine. Coeliac disease occurs in 1% of the population and requires strict, life-long avoidance of gluten-containing foods as the only medical treatment. There is a larger group of individuals (around 10-15% of the population) who report a wide-range of gastrointestinal symptoms that respond well to a 'gluten-free diet', but who do not have coeliac disease - so called 'non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS)'. The team at Monash University has identified other factors in gluten-containing foods that may be responsible for symptoms in this group of individuals with so-called, NCGS. We have evidence that certain poorly absorbed short chain carbohydrates (called FODMAPs) present in many gluten-containing food products, induce symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, wind and altered bowel habit (associated with irritable bowel syndrome, IBS). Our research has shown that FODMAPs, and not gluten, triggered symptoms in NCGS. Going forward, there are great opportunities for the food industry to develop low FODMAP products for this group, as choice of grain variety and type of food processing technique can greatly reduce the FODMAP levels in foods. The use of sourdough cultures in bread making has been shown to reduce the quantities of FODMAPs (mostly fructan), resulting in bread products that are well tolerated by patients with IBS. Greater interaction between biomedical- and food-scientists will improve understanding about the clinical problems many consumers face, and lead to the development of food products that are better tolerated by this group.","Bread, Celiac Disease, Cross-Sectional Studies, Diet, Gluten-Free, Dietary Fiber, Food Handling, Fructans, Glutens, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Triticum, Wheat Hypersensitivity","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Fiber"", ""value"": ""Dietary Fiber"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",2019-Feb-02,"J G Muir, J E Varney, M Ajamian, P R Gibson",International journal of food microbiology,2019,Journal Article,"

Of note, both qualitative and quantitative differences have been observed in the gut microbiota of a population with IBS versus a healthy population. Because of the substantial interest in the gut microbiota and its role as a therapeutic target in IBS, this article provides an overview of specific interventions with the potential to modulate the gut microbiota in IBS, including elimination diets, prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, and nonsystemic antibiotics. Although probiotics and synbiotics are generally well tolerated, differences in the composition and concentration of different bacterial species and inclusion or exclusion of prebiotic components varies widely across studies and has prevented strong recommendations on their use in IBS. For nonsystemic antibiotics, rifaximin is indicated in the United States for the treatment of IBS with diarrhea in adults and has been shown to be efficacious and well tolerated in well-designed clinical trials. Overall, more consistent evidence is needed regarding the efficacy and safety of elimination diets, prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics for the treatment of patients with IBS. Furthermore, additional well-designed studies are needed that examine alterations in the gut microbiota that occur with these interventions and their potential associations with clinical symptoms of IBS.","Anti-Bacterial Agents, Clinical Trials as Topic, Diet, Dietary Supplements, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Prebiotics, Probiotics, Rifamycins, Rifaximin, Synbiotics","[{""label"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""value"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Fiber"", ""value"": ""Dietary Fiber"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"Lucinda A Harris, Noemi Baffy",Postgraduate medicine,2017,"Journal Article, Review","

Profound alterations in the microbiota accompany IGE yet only 10% of IGE patients progress to PI-IBS. This review explores research linking IGE severity, psychological comorbidity, PI-IBS, and the microbiome in various patient populations. Selective pressures caused by inflammation and increased gastrointestinal motility during gastroenteritis can alter intestinal bacterial phyla including Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. More specifically, classes such as Bacteroides and Clostridia are differentially abundant in many PI-IBS patients. Altered microbiota may perpetuate a cycle of enteric and systemic inflammation, potently activating neural afferent signaling in the enteric nervous system and causing pain and diarrhea in PI-IBS patients. Altered production of microbial metabolites, for example short chain fatty acids, may have enteric and systemic effects on the host. Longitudinal sampling to characterize changes in the microbiota's genetic, metabolic, and transcriptional activities over time from IGE to PI-IBS may enable improved diagnosis and classification of PI-IBS cases into subtypes, allowing for targeted antibiotic, probiotic, and prebiotic treatments.

It is widely believed that IBS is caused by a deficient intake of dietary fiber, and most physicians recommend that patients with IBS increase their intake of dietary fiber in order to relieve their symptoms. However, different types of dietary fiber exhibit marked differences in physical and chemical properties, and the associated health benefits are specific for each fiber type. Short-chain soluble and highly fermentable dietary fiber, such as oligosaccharides results in rapid gas production that can cause abdominal pain/discomfort, abdominal bloating/distension and flatulence in patients with IBS. By contrast, long-chain, intermediate viscous, soluble and moderately fermentable dietary fiber, such as psyllium results in a low gas production and the absence of the symptoms related to excessive gas production. The effects of type of fiber have been documented in the management of IBS, and it is known to improve the overall symptoms in patients with IBS. Dietary fiber acts on the gastrointestinal tract through several mechanisms, including increased fecal mass with mechanical stimulation/irritation of the colonic mucosa with increasing secretion and peristalsis, and the actions of fermentation byproducts, particularly short-chain fatty acids, on the intestinal microbiota, immune system and the neuroendocrine system of the gastrointestinal tract.

The synbiotic product contained Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5, Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis BB-12, Streptococcus thermophilus, and dietary fiber (90% inulin, 10% oligofructose), and a heat-treated fermented milk without probiotic bacteria or dietary fiber served as placebo. Stool samples were collected after a run-in period, a 4-wk consumption period, and a 1-wk follow-up period, and were subjected to real-time PCR and 16S rDNA profiling by next-generation sequencing. After 4wk of synbiotic (11 subjects) or placebo (19 subjects) consumption, a greater increase in DNA specific for L. acidophilus La-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis was detected in the feces of the synbiotic group compared with the placebo group by quantitative real-time PCR. After 1wk of follow-up, the content of L. acidophilus La-5 and B. animalis ssp. lactis decreased to levels close to initial levels. No significant changes with time or differences between the groups were observed for Lactobacillus, Enterobacteriaceae, Bifidobacterium, or all bacteria. The presence of viable BB-12- and La-5-like bacteria in the feces resulting from the intake of synbiotic product was confirmed by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR. At the end of consumption period, the feces of all subjects assigned to the synbiotic group contained viable bacteria with a BB-12-like RAPD profile, and after 1wk of follow-up, BB-12-like bacteria remained in the feces of 87.5% of these subjects. The presence of La-5-like colonies was observed less frequently (37.5 and 25% of subjects, respectively). Next-generation sequencing of 16S rDNA amplicons revealed that only the percentage of sequences assigned to Strep. thermophilus was temporarily increased in both groups, whereas the global profile of the fecal microbiota of patients was not altered by consumption of the synbiotic or placebo.

This review describes the role of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBS and how dietary strategies to manage symptoms impact on the microbial community. Evidence suggests a dysbiosis of the luminal and mucosal colonic microbiota in IBS, frequently characterised by a reduction in species of Bifidobacteria which has been associated with worse symptom profile. Probiotic supplementation trials suggest intentional modulation of the GI microbiota may be effective in treating IBS. A smaller number of prebiotic supplementation studies have also demonstrated effectiveness in IBS whilst increasing Bifidobacteria. In contrast, a novel method of managing IBS symptoms is the restriction of short-chain fermentable carbohydrates (low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet). Studies consistently demonstrate clinical effectiveness of the low FODMAP diet in patients with IBS. However, one unintentional consequence of this dietary intervention is its impact on the microbiota. This leads to an interesting paradox; namely, increasing luminal Bifidobacteria through probiotic supplementation is associated with a reduction in IBS symptoms while in direct conflict to this, the low FODMAP diet has clinical efficacy but markedly reduces luminal Bifidobacteria concentration. Given the multifactorial aetiology of IBS, the heterogeneity of symptoms and the complex and diverse nature of the microbiome, it is probable that both interventions are effective in patient subgroups. However combination treatment has never been explored and as such, presents an exciting opportunity for optimising clinical management, whilst preventing potentially deleterious effects on the GI microbiota.","Diet, Disaccharides, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Meta-Analysis as Topic, Monosaccharides, Observational Studies as Topic, Oligosaccharides, Polymers, Prebiotics, Probiotics, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","[{""label"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""value"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Fiber"", ""value"": ""Dietary Fiber"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"Heidi M Staudacher, Kevin Whelan",The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2016,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review","

Two reviewers screened the title/abstract and full text against the inclusion criterion - that is, randomized control trials/crossover studies that compare fiber with placebo for its effect on IBS in an outpatient setting. Independent double data extraction was performed across multiple fields. An assessment of the risk of bias and tests for heterogeneity were carried out, along with a meta-analysis of the outcomes of interest. The search yielded 4199 unique records: 121 were selected after title/abstract screening and 22 after full screening.

This review aimed at presenting the recent developments concerning the role of diet in the pathophysiology and management of IBS. There is no convincing evidence that IBS patients suffer from food allergy/intolerance, and there is no evidence that gluten causes the debated new diagnosis of non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). The component in wheat that triggers symptoms in NCGS appears to be the carbohydrates. Patients with NCGS appear to be IBS patients who are self-diagnosed and self-treated with a gluten-free diet. IBS symptoms are triggered by the consumption of the poorly absorbed fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) and insoluble fibre. On reaching the distal small intestine and colon, FODMAPS and insoluble fibre increase the osmotic pressure in the large-intestine lumen and provide a substrate for bacterial fermentation, with consequent gas production, abdominal distension and abdominal pain or discomfort. Poor FODMAPS and insoluble fibres diet reduces the symptom and improve the quality of life in IBS patients. Moreover, it changes favourably the intestinal microbiota and restores the abnormalities in the gastrointestinal endocrine cells. Five gastrointestinal endocrine cell types that produce hormones regulating appetite and food intake are abnormal in IBS patients. Based on these hormonal abnormalities, one would expect that IBS patients to have increased food intake and body weight gain. However, the link between obesity and IBS is not fully studied. Individual dietary guidance for intake of poor FODMAPs and insoluble fibres diet in combination with probiotics intake and regular exercise is to be recommended for IBS patients.","Diet, Diet, Gluten-Free, Dietary Carbohydrates, Dietary Fiber, Enteroendocrine Cells, Exercise, Feeding Behavior, Fermentation, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Probiotics, Quality of Life","[{""label"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""value"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Exercise"", ""value"": ""Exercise"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Quality of Life"", ""value"": ""Quality of Life"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Fiber"", ""value"": ""Dietary Fiber"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",2015-Apr-14,"Magdy El-Salhy, Doris Gundersen",Nutrition journal,2015,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review","

Few and disappointing data are available for prebiotics. A few controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics are instead available with favourable effects, although most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size. A recent report from the Rome foundation group included 32 RCTs of probiotics, most of which showed an overall modest improvement in symptoms, with the patients most benefitting from probiotics being those with predominant diarrhoea and those having a post-infectious IBS. A review focusing only on children with functional gastrointestinal disorders concluded that probiotics are more effective than placebo in the treatment of patients with abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders, although no effect on constipation was evident. The role for probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) appears logical: the endogenous intestinal microbiota plays a central role in their development, and various probiotics have been found effective in animal models of IBD. However, research in humans has been overall quite limited, and it would seem that after a phase of intense research in the first decade of this century, the pace has slowed down, with fewer clinical trials been published in the past 2-3 years. To summarize current evidence: no probiotic has proven successful in Crohn's disease. In ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, data are more promising, and a very recent meta-analysis, that included 23 randomized controlled trials, concluded that there is evidence of efficacy for the probiotic mixture VSL#3 in helping inducing and maintaining remission, as well as in maintaining remission in patients with pouchitis.

Although studies of animal models of intestinal inflammation produced promising results, trials in humans have been disappointing. In contrast to IBD, the role of the microbiota in the development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) only recently has been considered, but early stage results have been encouraging. As pharmaceutical companies develop fewer truly novel agents for treatment of these disorders, consumers seek safer, long-term strategies to deal with chronic symptoms. We assess the rationale for modulating the microbiota for treatment of IBD and IBS, and discuss whether current concepts are simplistic and overstated or simply under-researched. Are claims exaggerated and expectations unrealistic?

Evidence-based treatment guidelines have not been able to give guidance on the effects of homeopathic treatment for IBS because no systematic reviews have been carried out to assess the effectiveness of homeopathic treatment for IBS. Two types of homeopathic treatment were evaluated in this systematic review. In clinical homeopathy a specific remedy is prescribed for a specific condition. This differs from individualised homeopathic treatment, where a homeopathic remedy based on a person's individual symptoms is prescribed after a detailed consultation.</p><p><b>OBJECTIVES</b>:<br>To assess the effectiveness and safety of homeopathic treatment for treating IBS.</p><p><b>SEARCH METHODS</b>:<br>We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field Specialised Register and the database of the Homeopathic Library (Hom-inform) from inception to February 2013.</p><p><b>SELECTION CRITERIA</b>:<br>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort and case-control studies that compared homeopathic treatment with placebo, other control treatments, or usual care, in adults with IBS were considered for inclusion.</p><p><b>DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS</b>:<br>Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. The primary outcome was global improvement in IBS. The overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was assessed using the GRADE criteria. We calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous outcomes and the risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes.</p><p><b>MAIN RESULTS</b>:<br>Three RCTs (213 participants) were included. No cohort or case-control studies were identified. Two studies published in 1976 and 1979 compared clinical homeopathy (homeopathic remedy) to placebo for constipation-predominant IBS. One study published in 1990 compared individualised homeopathic treatment (consultation plus remedy) to usual care (defined as high doses of dicyclomine hydrochloride, faecal bulking agents and diet sheets asking the patient to take a high fibre diet) for the treatment of IBS in female patients. Due to the low quality of reporting in the included studies the risk of bias in all three studies was unclear on most criteria and high for some criteria. A meta-analysis of two small studies (129 participants with constipation-predominant IBS) found a statistically significant difference in global improvement between the homeopathic remedy asafoetida and placebo at a short-term follow-up of two weeks. Seventy-three per cent of patients in the homeopathy group improved compared to 45% of placebo patients (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.18). There was no statistically significant difference in global improvement between the homeopathic remedies asafoetida plus nux vomica and placebo. Sixty-eight per cent of patients in the homeopathy group improved compared to 52% of placebo patients (1 study, N = 42, RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.15). GRADE analyses rated the overall quality of the evidence for the outcome global improvement as very low due to high or unknown risk of bias, short-term follow-up and sparse data. There was no statistically significant difference found between individualised homeopathic treatment and usual care (1 RCT, N = 20) for the outcome ""feeling unwell"", where the participant scored how ""unwell"" they felt before, and after treatment (MD 0.03; 95% CI -3.16 to 3.22). None of the included studies reported on adverse events.</p><p><b>AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS</b>:<br>A pooled analysis of two small studies suggests a possible benefit for clinical homeopathy, using the remedy asafoetida, over placebo for people with constipation-predominant IBS. These results should be interpreted with caution due to the low quality of reporting in these trials, high or unknown risk of bias, short-term follow-up, and sparse data. One small study found no statistically difference between individualised homeopathy and usual care (defined as high doses of dicyclomine hydrochloride, faecal bulking agents and diet sheets advising a high fibre diet). No conclusions can be drawn from this study due to the low number of participants and the high risk of bias in this trial. In addition, it is likely that usual care has changed since this trial was conducted. Further high quality, adequately powered RCTs are required to assess the efficacy and safety of clinical and individualised homeopathy compared to placebo or usual care</p>","Adult, Constipation, Dicyclomine, Dietary Fiber, Female, Ferula, Homeopathy, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Male, Phytotherapy, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Constipation"", ""value"": ""Constipation"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Fiber"", ""value"": ""Dietary Fiber"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",2013-Nov-13,"Emily J Peckham, E Andrea Nelson, Joanne Greenhalgh, Katy Cooper, E Rachel Roberts, Anurag Agrawal",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2013,"Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review, Systematic Review","

There is evidence that they are linked - both caused by attenuation of gravitational aid to distal intestinal motility, resulting in damaging chronic intestinal distention.

Although the use of fiber rich diet is widely recommended in treating IBS, some studies have questioned its use. Intra-colonic butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid, is primarily produced by the fermentation of dietary fibers in the colon. In the existing literature there are conflicting reports about the function of butyrate.

Combinations of drugs to target bothersome symptoms are suggested as the first-line pharmacologic treatment. Increasing knowledge of the pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms of IBS has resulted in the development of several new therapeutic approaches. Thirteen consensus statements for the treatment of IBS were developed using the modified Delphi approach. Exclusion diets have modest efficacy in improving symptoms in some IBS patients. Symptom-based therapies with dietary fiber, bulking agents, laxatives, antispasmodics and laxatives are effective in the improvement of some individual symptoms, e.g. dietary fiber and bulking agents for constipation, laxatives for constipation, antispasmodics for abdominal pain and discomfort, antidiarrheals for diarrhea. 5HT3 receptor antagonists and 5HT((4)) receptor agonists are effective in the relief of global IBS symptoms and individual symptoms such as abdominal pain and abnormal bowel habits. A short term course of nonabsorbable antibiotics may improve global IBS symptoms, particularly in patients with diarrhea- predominant IBS. Some probiotics appear to have the potential benefit in improving global IBS symptoms. Selective C-2 chloride channel activator is more effective than placebo at relieving global IBS symptoms in patients with constipation-predominant IBS.

Studies suggest that IBS symptoms in one quarter of patients may be caused or exacerbated by one or more dietary components. Recent studies indicate that a diet restricted in fermentable, poorly absorbed carbohydrates, including fructose, fructans (present in wheat and onions), sorbitol, and other sugar alcohols is beneficial, but confirmatory studies are needed. Despite a long history of enthusiastic use, fiber is marginally beneficial. Insoluble fiber may worsen symptoms. Some patients with IBS, especially those with constipation, will improve with increased intake of soluble fiber. Prebiotic fibers have not been adequately tested. Daily use of peppermint oil is effective in relieving IBS symptoms. The usefulness of probiotics in the form of foods such as live-culture yogurt and buttermilk for IBS symptoms is not established. In clinical practice, it is very difficult to establish that a patient's symptoms result from an adverse reaction to food. A double blind placebo-controlled food challenge is the most reliable method, but it is not suitable for routine clinical use. A modified exclusion diet and stepwise reintroduction of foods or trials of eliminating classes of food may be useful.","Constipation, Diet, Dietary Fiber, Fermentation, Food Hypersensitivity, Fructose Intolerance, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Lactose Intolerance, Mentha piperita, Plant Oils, Probiotics, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Sorbitol","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Constipation"", ""value"": ""Constipation"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Fiber"", ""value"": ""Dietary Fiber"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"William D Heizer, Susannah Southern, Susan McGovern",Journal of the American Dietetic Association,2009,"Journal Article, Review","

Since there is no evidence that IBS leads to more severe gastrointestinal disorders, in absence of alarm symptoms or signs, an invasive diagnostic algorithm is not indicated. Optimal treatment for IBS still needs to be defined. The clinical approach is based on treatment of the prevalent symptom. When pain predominates, antispasmodics are the first choice.

Both doctors and patients are frustrated by the insidious nature of IBS--a nonlethal disorder that destroys lives, relationships, and careers. Traditional therapies are sometimes effective in mild disease but are often self-limiting because they focus primarily on individual symptoms. A combination of lifestyle and diet modifications, pharmacologic agents, and therapeutic interventions is usually necessary to address the multiple symptoms characteristic of IBS. One of the major advancements in the treatment of patients with IBS has been the development of US Food and Drug Administration--approved serotonergic therapeutics that specifically target the underlying causes of IBS and provide multisymptom relief by improving gastrointestinal function. Although they are controversial, alternative treatment approaches that target normalization of intestinal bacterial microflora may be helpful for some patients in whom intestinal bacterial overgrowth is present. Patients who have co-existing pelvic floor dysfunction may benefit from physical therapy. Overall, treatment approaches for IBS should address multisymptom relief and improvement of overall patient well-being.","Abdominal Pain, Antidepressive Agents, Antidiarrheals, Cathartics, Diet, Dietary Fiber, Gastrointestinal Agents, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Life Style, Parasympatholytics, Physical Therapy Modalities, Probiotics, Psychotherapy","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Abdominal Pain"", ""value"": ""Abdominal Pain"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Fiber"", ""value"": ""Dietary Fiber"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,Christine L Frissora,Reviews in gastroenterological disorders,2007,"Journal Article, Review","

The therapeutic approach to patients with IBS is based on symptoms, and fibers may play an important role in treatment. Among the various types of fiber, water-soluble, non-gelling fibers seem to be a promising option for treatment of IBS. Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) is a water-soluble, non-gelling fiber that has provided therapeutic benefits. In clinical trials, PHGG decreased symptoms in constipation-predominant and diarrhea-predominant forms of IBS and decreased abdominal pain. Further, an improvement in quality of life was observed in patients with IBS during and after treatment with PHGG.

Many investigators have studied the effectiveness of either fiber supplementation or bulking agents in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current literature on the use of fiber in irritable bowel syndrome and to provide some specific recommendations. Systematic reviews of these trials have generally not found fiber to be significantly more effective than placebo at relieving global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. There may be differences between results obtained with soluble and insoluble fiber. Adverse effects of fiber use may include abdominal discomfort and bloating. Although dietary fiber or bulking agents do not appear to be useful as sole treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, they may have a limited role in empiric therapy depending upon the patient's symptom complex, especially if constipation is the most significant symptom.

A longitudinal, prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was undertaken. The duration of treatment was eight to 12 weeks and this consisted of 10-20 g/day of coarse wheat bran or a low fibre placebo taken in addition to the normal diet. Twenty-eight outpatients fulfilling the Rome criteria for constipation-predominant IBS were recruited to the trial (14 in the treatment group; 14 in the placebo group). Twelve people completed the trial in the treatment group and ten in the placebo group. The main outcome measures included changes in symptoms recorded in a diary, changes in objective measurements of bowel function and subjective overall feelings of improvement. The bran group significantly increased their non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) intake over that of the placebo group (p &lt; 0.05). Mean stool wet weight increased significantly more in the bran group than in the placebo group (p &lt; 0.05), but other bowel function measurements and all recorded symptoms were not different. Many patients reported changes in bowel habit that were not reflected in the objective measurements. The addition of coarse wheat bran to the diet increased NSP ingestion and stool wet weight in this group of IBS patients, but no evidence was obtained that such treatment was of benefit to these patients, other than a placebo effect on symptoms.","Abdominal Pain, Adult, Aged, Dietary Fiber, Feces, Female, Humans, Intestine, Small, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Longitudinal Studies, Male, Middle Aged, Placebos, Prospective Studies, Treatment Outcome","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Abdominal Pain"", ""value"": ""Abdominal Pain"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Fiber"", ""value"": ""Dietary Fiber"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"Gail Rees, Jill Davies, Richard Thompson, Mike Parker, Peter Liepins",The journal of the Royal Society for the Promotion of Health,2005,"Clinical Trial, Comparative Study, Journal Article, Randomized Controlled Trial","

Different food items which are commonly implicated in adverse reactions mimicking IBS were found to be stimulants for the gut, suggesting that patients with predominant diarrhea IBS have to be carefully questioned about consumption of different kinds of food (i.e., coffee, alcohol, chewing gum, soft drinks) and not only on lactose ingestion. Gas production is discussed on the basis of retention of intestinal gas as well as on malabsorption of fermentable substrates. The role of a large amount of this kind of substrate reaching the colon is suggested as a potential mechanism of IBS-type symptoms in overeating patients.

It is estimated that even up to 45% of the world's population can suffer from the disease. The first attempts to diagnose irritable bowel syndrome were made at the end of the 19th century; however, establishing appropriate diagnostic criteria and treatment methods is still ongoing. To date, little is known about the etiology of irritable bowel syndrome; however, growing attention is drawn to the intestinal microbiota as a factor in the disease development.

The effects of diet seem to be a result of an interaction with the gut bacteria and the gut endocrine cells. The density of gut endocrine cells is low in IBS patients, and it is believed that this abnormality is the direct cause of the symptoms seen in IBS patients. The low density of gut endocrine cells is probably caused by a low number of stem cells and low differentiation progeny toward endocrine cells. A low fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharide, and polyol (FODMAP) diet and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) restore the gut endocrine cells to the level of healthy subjects. It has been suggested that our diet acts as a prebiotic that favors the growth of a certain types of bacteria. Diet also acts as a substrate for gut bacteria fermentation, which results in several by-products. These by-products might act on the stem cells in such a way that the gut stem cells decrease, and consequently, endocrine cell numbers decrease. Changing to a low-FODMAP diet or changing the gut bacteria through FMT improves IBS symptoms and restores the density of endocrine cells.","Cell Differentiation, Diet, Diet, Carbohydrate-Restricted, Enteroendocrine Cells, Fecal Microbiota Transplantation, Fermentation, Gastrointestinal Hormones, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Monosaccharides, Polysaccharides, Prebiotics, Quality of Life, Stem Cells","[{""label"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""value"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Quality of Life"", ""value"": ""Quality of Life"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Prebiotics"", ""value"": ""Prebiotics"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",2019-Aug-07,"Magdy El-Salhy, Jan Gunnar Hatlebakk, Trygve Hausken",Nutrients,2019,"Journal Article, Review","

While the pathogenesis is not clearly understood, current research points to the role of the gut microbiome and alterations in the diversity of the microbiota. Probiotics, prebiotics, and low FODMAP diet are therapeutic means associated with modification of the gut microbiome for the alleviation of IBS symptoms. This narrative review assesses the current evidence on the efficacy of these treatment options based on findings from recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses published from October 2013 to October 2018. There is a general agreement in the 11 included systematic reviews and meta-analyses that probiotic therapy is safe and can be effective in improving overall IBS symptom scores and abdominal pain in the general IBS population. Nonetheless, conflicting findings remain and no recommendation on the specific species/strains or combination can be made. Short-term restriction of FODMAP in the diet can improve IBS symptoms as per the findings of 7 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, even though the quality of the evidence remains questionable. Inappropriate use of the low FODMAP diet can potentially impact health negatively. As such, a low FODMAP diet is only recommended as a second line treatment guided by qualified clinicians with specialized training. Despite preclinical studies of some prebiotics demonstrated the potential use in improving gut microbiome and intestinal inflammatory response, the beneficial effect of prebiotics for IBS remains theoretical.

We explored the possible mechanisms both in animal and in cells. Post-infectious IBS models in C57BL/6 mice were established and were pretreated with the PB, PB and probiotic strains 8 weeks in advance of infection. Eight weeks after infection, intestinal tissues were collected for assessing histomorphology, visceral sensitivity, barrier function, pro-inflammatory cytokines expression and proteomics analysis. Fecal samples were also collected for microbiota analysis. The pro-inflammatory cytokines expression in Caco-2 cells were evaluated after co-incubation with PB and <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> 14028. The results showed that PB significantly decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokines both in infected Caco-2 cells and PI-IBS models. The loss of body weight, decreased expression of tight junction protein Occludin (OCLN), and changes of the microbiota composition induced by infections could be greatly improved by PB intervention (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).

IBS is a substantial burden on both patient health-related quality of life and healthcare costs. Several pathophysiologic mechanisms have been postulated for the occurrence of IBS, including altered gastrointestinal motility, visceral hypersensitivity, changes in gut permeability, immune activation, gut-brain dysregulation, central nervous system dysfunction, and changes in the gut microbiota. Of note, both qualitative and quantitative differences have been observed in the gut microbiota of a population with IBS versus a healthy population. Because of the substantial interest in the gut microbiota and its role as a therapeutic target in IBS, this article provides an overview of specific interventions with the potential to modulate the gut microbiota in IBS, including elimination diets, prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, and nonsystemic antibiotics. Although probiotics and synbiotics are generally well tolerated, differences in the composition and concentration of different bacterial species and inclusion or exclusion of prebiotic components varies widely across studies and has prevented strong recommendations on their use in IBS. For nonsystemic antibiotics, rifaximin is indicated in the United States for the treatment of IBS with diarrhea in adults and has been shown to be efficacious and well tolerated in well-designed clinical trials. Overall, more consistent evidence is needed regarding the efficacy and safety of elimination diets, prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics for the treatment of patients with IBS. Furthermore, additional well-designed studies are needed that examine alterations in the gut microbiota that occur with these interventions and their potential associations with clinical symptoms of IBS.","Anti-Bacterial Agents, Clinical Trials as Topic, Diet, Dietary Supplements, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Prebiotics, Probiotics, Rifamycins, Rifaximin, Synbiotics","[{""label"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""value"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Prebiotics"", ""value"": ""Prebiotics"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"Lucinda A Harris, Noemi Baffy",Postgraduate medicine,2017,"Journal Article, Review","

Profound alterations in the microbiota accompany IGE yet only 10% of IGE patients progress to PI-IBS. This review explores research linking IGE severity, psychological comorbidity, PI-IBS, and the microbiome in various patient populations. Selective pressures caused by inflammation and increased gastrointestinal motility during gastroenteritis can alter intestinal bacterial phyla including Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. More specifically, classes such as Bacteroides and Clostridia are differentially abundant in many PI-IBS patients. Altered microbiota may perpetuate a cycle of enteric and systemic inflammation, potently activating neural afferent signaling in the enteric nervous system and causing pain and diarrhea in PI-IBS patients. Altered production of microbial metabolites, for example short chain fatty acids, may have enteric and systemic effects on the host. Longitudinal sampling to characterize changes in the microbiota's genetic, metabolic, and transcriptional activities over time from IGE to PI-IBS may enable improved diagnosis and classification of PI-IBS cases into subtypes, allowing for targeted antibiotic, probiotic, and prebiotic treatments.

This review describes the role of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBS and how dietary strategies to manage symptoms impact on the microbial community. Evidence suggests a dysbiosis of the luminal and mucosal colonic microbiota in IBS, frequently characterised by a reduction in species of Bifidobacteria which has been associated with worse symptom profile. Probiotic supplementation trials suggest intentional modulation of the GI microbiota may be effective in treating IBS. A smaller number of prebiotic supplementation studies have also demonstrated effectiveness in IBS whilst increasing Bifidobacteria. In contrast, a novel method of managing IBS symptoms is the restriction of short-chain fermentable carbohydrates (low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet). Studies consistently demonstrate clinical effectiveness of the low FODMAP diet in patients with IBS. However, one unintentional consequence of this dietary intervention is its impact on the microbiota. This leads to an interesting paradox; namely, increasing luminal Bifidobacteria through probiotic supplementation is associated with a reduction in IBS symptoms while in direct conflict to this, the low FODMAP diet has clinical efficacy but markedly reduces luminal Bifidobacteria concentration. Given the multifactorial aetiology of IBS, the heterogeneity of symptoms and the complex and diverse nature of the microbiome, it is probable that both interventions are effective in patient subgroups. However combination treatment has never been explored and as such, presents an exciting opportunity for optimising clinical management, whilst preventing potentially deleterious effects on the GI microbiota.","Diet, Disaccharides, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Meta-Analysis as Topic, Monosaccharides, Observational Studies as Topic, Oligosaccharides, Polymers, Prebiotics, Probiotics, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","[{""label"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""value"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Prebiotics"", ""value"": ""Prebiotics"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"Heidi M Staudacher, Kevin Whelan",The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2016,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review","

Few and disappointing data are available for prebiotics. A few controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics are instead available with favourable effects, although most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size. A recent report from the Rome foundation group included 32 RCTs of probiotics, most of which showed an overall modest improvement in symptoms, with the patients most benefitting from probiotics being those with predominant diarrhoea and those having a post-infectious IBS. A review focusing only on children with functional gastrointestinal disorders concluded that probiotics are more effective than placebo in the treatment of patients with abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders, although no effect on constipation was evident. The role for probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) appears logical: the endogenous intestinal microbiota plays a central role in their development, and various probiotics have been found effective in animal models of IBD. However, research in humans has been overall quite limited, and it would seem that after a phase of intense research in the first decade of this century, the pace has slowed down, with fewer clinical trials been published in the past 2-3 years. To summarize current evidence: no probiotic has proven successful in Crohn's disease. In ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, data are more promising, and a very recent meta-analysis, that included 23 randomized controlled trials, concluded that there is evidence of efficacy for the probiotic mixture VSL#3 in helping inducing and maintaining remission, as well as in maintaining remission in patients with pouchitis.

There were exceptions; no differences were observed for IBS-D-SSS between the IgG res diet and CSF‚Äâ+‚ÄâIgG res diet, or TIgG grade between the CSF res diet, IgG res diet, and CSF‚Äâ+‚ÄâIgG res diet. However, the CSF res diet and IgG res diet had a synergistic effect that decreased IBS-D-SSS and TIgG titer, with a greater contribution by the IgG res diet.

Current symptom-based definitions and the classification of IBS promote heterogeneity amongst patients, meaning that there may be several different pathophysiological abnormalities leading to similar symptoms. Although our understanding of IBS is incomplete, there are several indicators that the microbiome may be involved in a subset of patients. Techniques including a faecal sample analysis, colonic biopsies, duodenal aspirates or surrogate markers, such as breath testing, have been used to examine the gut microbiota in individuals with IBS. Because of a lack of a clear definition of what constitutes a healthy gut microbiota, and the fact that alterations in gut microbiota have only been shown to be associated with IBS, a causal relationship is yet to be established. We discuss several hypotheses as to how dysbiosis may be responsible for IBS symptoms, as well as potential treatment strategies. We review the current evidence for the use of antibiotics and probiotics to alter the microbiome in an attempt to improve IBS symptoms. Rifaximin, a non-absorbable antibiotic, is the most studied antibiotic and has now been licensed for use in IBS with diarrhoea in the USA, but the drug remains unavailable in many countries for this indication. Current evidence also suggests that certain probiotics, including Lactobacillus plantarum DSM 9843 and Bifidobacterium bifidum MIMBb75, may be efficacious in some patients with IBS.

Convincing evidence of the clinical efficacy of autoprobiotic was demonstrated by the disappearance of dyspeptic symptoms. The microbiome of patients with IBS was compared to a group of healthy volunteers and changes in the microbiome after autoprobiotic use were detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and 16S rRNA metagenome analysis. The possibility of reducing opportunistic microorganisms in the treatment of IBS with autoprobiotics has been convincingly proven. The quantitative content of enterococci in the intestinal microbiota was higher in IBS patients than in healthy volunteers and increased after therapy. An increase in the relative abundance of genera <i>Coprococcus, Blautia</i> and a decrease in the relative abundance of <i>Paraprevotella</i> spp. were found at the end of therapy. A metabolome study which was performed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry demonstrated an increase in the content of oxalic acid, a decrease of dodecanoate, lauric acid, and other metabolome components after taking autoprobiotics. Some of these parameters correlated with the relative abundances of <i>Paraprevotella</i> spp., <i>Enterococcus</i> spp., and <i>Coprococcus</i> spp. representative of the microbiome.

It has been hypothesised that the use of micro-organisms, such as probiotics and synbiotics (a mixture of probiotics and prebiotics), might change the composition of bacterial colonies in the bowel and reduce inflammation, as well as promote normal gut physiology and reduce functional symptoms.</p><p><b>OBJECTIVES</b>:<br>To assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics in the treatment of functional abdominal pain disorders in children.</p><p><b>SEARCH METHODS</b>:<br>We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and two clinical trials registers from inception to October 2021.</p><p><b>SELECTION CRITERIA</b>:<br>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compare probiotic preparations (including synbiotics) to placebo, no treatment or any other interventional preparation in patients aged between 4 and 18 years of age with a diagnosis of functional abdominal pain disorder according to the Rome II, Rome III or Rome IV criteria.</p><p><b>DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS</b>:<br>The primary outcomes were treatment success as defined by the primary studies, complete resolution of pain, improvement in the severity of pain and improvement in the frequency of pain. Secondary outcomes included serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, adverse events, school performance or change in school performance or attendance, social and psychological functioning or change in social and psychological functioning, and quality of life or change in quality life measured using any validated scoring tool. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) and corresponding 95% CI.</p><p><b>MAIN RESULTS</b>:<br>We included 18 RCTs assessing the effectiveness of probiotics and synbiotics in reducing the severity and frequency of pain, involving a total of 1309 patients. Probiotics may achieve more treatment success when compared with placebo at the end of the treatment, with 50% success in the probiotic group versus 33% success in the placebo group (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.36; 554 participants; 6 studies; I<sup>2</sup> = 70%; low-certainty evidence).¬† It is not clear whether probiotics are more effective than placebo for complete resolution of pain, with 42% success in the probiotic group versus 27% success in the placebo group (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.56; 460 participants; 6 studies; I<sup>2</sup> = 70%; very low-certainty evidence). We judged the evidence to be of very low certainty due to high inconsistency and risk of bias. We were unable to draw meaningful conclusions from our meta-analyses of the pain severity and pain frequency outcomes due to very high unexplained heterogeneity leading to very low-certainty evidence. None of the included studies reported serious adverse events. Meta-analysis showed no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events between probiotics (1/275) and placebo (1/269) (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.12). The results were identical for the total patients with any reported adverse event outcome. However, these results are of very low certainty due to imprecision from the very low numbers of events and risk of bias. Synbiotics may result in more treatment success at study end when compared with placebo, with 47% success in the probiotic group versus 35% success in the placebo group (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.74; 310 participants; 4 studies; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; low certainty). One study used Bifidobacterium coagulans/fructo-oligosaccharide, one used Bifidobacterium lactis/inulin, one used Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG/inulin and in one study this was not stated).¬† Synbiotics may result in little difference in complete resolution of pain at study end when compared with placebo, with 52% success in the probiotic group versus 32% success in the placebo group (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.81; 131 participants; 2 studies; I<sup>2</sup> = 18%; low-certainty evidence). We were unable to draw meaningful conclusions from our meta-analyses of pain severity or frequency of pain due to very high unexplained heterogeneity leading to very low-certainty evidence.¬† None of the included studies reported serious adverse events. Meta-analysis showed little to no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events between synbiotics (8/155) and placebo (1/147) (RR 4.58, 95% CI 0.80 to 26.19), or in any reported adverse events (3/96 versus 1/93, RR 2.88, 95% CI 0.32 to 25.92). These results are of very low certainty due to imprecision from the very low numbers of events and risk of bias. There were insufficient data to analyse by subgroups of specific functional abdominal pain syndrome (irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, abdominal migraine, functional abdominal pain - not otherwise specified) or by specific strain of probiotic. There was insufficient evidence on school performance or change in school performance/attendance, social and psychological functioning, or quality of life to draw conclusions about the effects of probiotics or synbiotics on these outcomes.</p><p><b>AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS</b>:<br>The results from this review demonstrate that probiotics and synbiotics may be more efficacious than placebo in achieving treatment success, but the evidence is of low certainty. The evidence demonstrates little to no difference between probiotics or synbiotics and placebo in complete resolution of pain. We were unable to draw meaningful conclusions about the impact of probiotics or synbiotics on the frequency and severity of pain as the evidence was all of very low certainty due to significant unexplained heterogeneity or imprecision. There were no reported cases of serious adverse events when using probiotics or synbiotics amongst the included studies, although a review of RCTs may not be the best context to assess long-term safety. The available evidence on adverse effects was of very low certainty and no conclusions could be made in this review. Safety will always be a priority in paediatric populations when considering any treatment. Reporting of all adverse events, adverse events needing withdrawal, serious adverse events and, particularly, long-term safety outcomes are vital to meaningfully move forward the evidence base in this field. Further targeted and appropriately designed RCTs are needed to address the gaps in the evidence base. In particular, appropriate powering of studies to confirm the safety of specific strains not yet investigated and studies to investigate long-term follow-up of patients are both warranted</p>","Humans, Child, Child, Preschool, Adolescent, Inulin, Probiotics, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Abdominal Pain, Treatment Outcome","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Abdominal Pain"", ""value"": ""Abdominal Pain"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",2023-Feb-17,"Chris Wallace, Morris Gordon, Vassiliki Sinopoulou, Anthony K Akobeng",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2023,"Meta-Analysis, Systematic Review, Journal Article, Review","

The objective of this study is to determine whether the current recommendations regarding nutrition in IBS are suitable for patients with SIBO. A narrative literature review was carried out using databases, including PubMed, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar. Recent studies indicate that dietary manipulation may have a role in alleviating SIBO gastrointestinal symptoms. A low FODMAP diet proposed for IBS may promote a negative shift in the gut microbiota and deepen the existing state of dysbiosis in SIBO patients. Supplementation with soluble fiber can lessen the symptoms in IBS and SIBO. Targeted probiotic therapy may also increase the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment and regulate bowel movements.

In this article, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the efficacy of both probiotic- and drug interventions in IBS. Medline was searched between January 2015 - January 2021. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) recruiting participants &gt; 18 years old with IBS and examining the effect of probiotics or drugs were eligible for inclusion. The data of the primary outcome, i.e. the persistence of IBS symptoms (dichotomous symptom data), were pooled to obtain a relative risk (RR), with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Secondary outcomes, abdominal pain- and bloating scores (continuous data), were pooled using a standardised mean difference with a 95% CI. The search identified 269 citations of which 32 RCTs were eligible. Our meta-analysis indicated that both probiotic and drug interventions are able to improve the persistence of IBS symptoms (RR 0.60 [0.51; 0.92] versus 0.87 [0.81; 0.92], respectively) and abdominal pain scores (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.35 [-0.56; -0.14] versus -0.10 [-0.20; 0.00], respectively).

However, most RCT reporting has a stronger focus on efficacy rather than safety. This study aimed to identify the safety profile of both probiotic and drug interventions in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In connection to this paper, an accompanying paper was published in which a meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of probiotic interventions compared to that of drug interventions in IBS. Together, these two studies provide a first assessment regarding the feasibility to determine a burden to benefit ratio for both probiotic and drug interventions in IBS. RCTs including participants (&gt;18 years old) with IBS and comparing probiotic or drugs interventions with control groups were identified by a systematic search of MEDLINE (January 2015 - Jan 2021). Reported safety profiles in drug studies were completer and more detailed as compared with studies on probiotics. Several inconsistencies in safety reporting were identified between and within drug and probiotic studies, such as: didn't report on safety; only reported adverse reactions (ARs) or adverse events (AEs) with a certain severity; didn't report the total number of AEs; didn't split in the control- or experimental arm; didn't specify AEs; and used different thresholds for 'common' AEs. Hence, it is difficult to compare safety data from drug and probiotic RCTs across and between different studies. On the current approaches to safety reporting, we could not establish an unambiguous safety profile for neither probiotic and drug interventions in IBS. These shortcomings hamper a critical comparison of the burden to benefit ratio for IBS intervention.","Adolescent, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Probiotics, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Treatment Outcome","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",2022-Aug-03,"A M van der Geest, I Schukking, R J M Brummer, H Pieterse, M van den Nieuwboer, L H M van de Burgwal, O F A Larsen",Beneficial microbes,2022,"Journal Article, Review","

The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool. RevMan 5.3 was used to perform a meta-analysis on stool consistency, abdominal pain, bloating, quality of life (QoL), fecal Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus counts, and adverse events. The GRADE approach was used to evaluate the certainty of the evidence. Ten RCTs involving 757 patients were included. Only three studies were rated as having a low risk of bias. The meta-analysis results show that, compared to the placebo, probiotics significantly improved stool consistency (MD = 0.72, 95% CI (0.18, 1.26), p &lt; 0.05, low quality) and increased the number of fecal Bifidobacteria (MD = 1.75, 95% CI (1.51, 2.00), p &lt; 0.05, low quality) and Lactobacillus (MD = 1.69, 95% CI (1.48, 1.89), p &lt; 0.05, low quality), while no significant differences were found in abdominal pain scores, bloating scores, QoL scores, or the incidence of adverse events (p &gt; 0.05).

In our study we have used a rat model of visceral pain (72 animals; <i>n</i> = 8-13 per experimental group) to analyze the consequences of intracolonic administration of the irritant acetic acid on visceral sensitivity, histology of the colonic wall, and inflammatory response. Moreover, we have studied the possible beneficial effects of a pretreatment with a commercial probiotic (Actimel<sup>¬Æ</sup>). Contrary to expectations, acetic acid application (7 cm proximal to the anus) decreased the nociceptive response to intracolonic mechanical stimulation, with a slight increase in the histological damage of colonic mucosa. The intensity of these changes depended on the concentration (4% or 0.6%) and the time of application (30 or 60 min). Pretreatment with probiotics (by daily gavage, for 1 week) normalized the values obtained in the visceral sensitivity test but revealed an increase in the number of macrophages. These results suggest a possible activation of inhibitory mechanisms early after colonic irritation, not previously described (which need further experimental confirmation), and the ability of probiotics to normalize the effects of acetic acid. In addition, pretreatment with probiotics has a direct effect on immune functions, stimulating macrophagic activity.","Animals, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, Intestinal Mucosa, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Probiotics, Rats","[{""label"": ""Intestinal Mucosa"", ""value"": ""Intestinal Mucosa"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",2022-May-26,"Laura L√≥pez-G√≥mez, Jaime Ant√≥n, Yolanda L√≥pez-Tofi√±o, Bianca Pomana, Jos√© A Uranga, Raquel Abalo",International journal of environmental research and public health,2022,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","

In short-term studies, eHealth interventions have been demonstrated to be safe and practical for at-home monitoring of the effects of probiotic treatments and a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs). IBS has been linked to alterations in the microbiota.</p><p><b>OBJECTIVE</b>:<br>The aim of this study was to determine whether a web-based low-FODMAP diet (LFD) intervention and probiotic treatment were equally good at reducing IBS symptoms, and whether the response to treatments could be explained by patients' microbiota.</p><p><b>METHODS</b>:<br>Adult IBS patients were enrolled in an open-label, randomized crossover trial (for nonresponders) with 1 year of follow-up using the web application IBS Constant Care (IBS CC). Patients were recruited from the outpatient clinic at the Department of Gastroenterology, North Zealand University Hospital, Denmark. Patients received either VSL#3 for 4 weeks (2 √ó 450 billion colony-forming units per day) or were placed on an LFD for 4 weeks. Patients responding to the LFD were reintroduced to foods high in FODMAPs, and probiotic responders received treatments whenever they experienced a flare-up of symptoms. Treatment response and symptom flare-ups were defined as a reduction or increase, respectively, of at least 50 points on the IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS). Web-based ward rounds were performed daily by the study investigator. Fecal microbiota were analyzed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing (at least 10 million 2 √ó 100 bp paired-end sequencing reads per sample).</p><p><b>RESULTS</b>:<br>A total of 34 IBS patients without comorbidities and 6 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Taken from participating subjects, 180 fecal samples were analyzed for their microbiota composition. Out of 21 IBS patients, 12 (57%) responded to the LFD and 8 (38%) completed the reintroduction of FODMAPs. Out of 21 patients, 13 (62%) responded to their first treatment of VSL#3 and 7 (33%) responded to multiple VSL#3 treatments. A median of 3 (IQR 2.25-3.75) probiotic treatments were needed for sustained symptom control. LFD responders were reintroduced to a median of 14.50 (IQR 7.25-21.75) high-FODMAP items. No significant difference in the median reduction of IBS-SSS for LFD versus probiotic responders was observed, where for LFD it was -126.50 (IQR -196.75 to -76.75) and for VSL#3 it was -130.00 (IQR -211.00 to -70.50; P&gt;.99).

Functional imaging of IBS patients has revealed several abnormalities in various brain regions, such as significant activation of amygdala, thinning of insular and anterior cingulate cortex, and increase in hypothalamic gray matter, which results in poor psychiatric and cognitive outcomes. Interrelations between the enteric and central events in IBS-related gastrointestinal, neurological, and psychiatric pathologies have compelled researchers to study the gut-brain axis-a bidirectional communication that maintains the homeostasis of the gastrointestinal and central nervous system with gut microbiota as the protagonist. Thus, it can be disrupted by any alteration owing to the gut dysbiosis or loss of diversity in microbial composition. Available evidence indicates that the use of probiotics as a part of a balanced diet is effective in the management of IBS and IBS-associated neurodegenerative and psychiatric comorbidities.

Therefore, IBS commonly impairs the quality of life of patients, moreover, it is frequently linked to depressive and anxiety symptoms. The treatment of IBS primarily focuses on symptoms relief. Unfortunately, up to now, no efficacious therapies have been found. Therefore, it would be important to develop new anti- IBS interventions. The aim of this brief review is to summarize the current evidence of nutraceutical supplementation in IBS treatment, with probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, butyrate, palmitoylethanolamide and colostrum. Since nutraceutics are over-the-counter products, the review has the purpose to better inform the medicinal chemist and the practitioner about the possible beneficial mechanisms and the many advantages that these therapies offer. All of these compounds present multiple mechanisms of action, such as restoring the physiological microbiota, potentiating gastrointestinal barrier's function, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activities. From the literature data, it results that these compounds are not only capable of improving IBS symptomatology, but mainly display an optimal safety and tolerability profile. Although extensive studies must be carried out to reinforce the evidence from the so far limited clinical trials, the supplementation with these compounds may be useful considering the warnings of prescription medicines for special populations of patients, such as elders, youngsters, or patients who need combination therapy. Finally, the nutraceutical approach may improve adherence to treatment, given its better acceptance by the patients compared to pharmacological therapy.","Abdominal Pain, Aged, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Prebiotics, Probiotics, Quality of Life, Synbiotics","[{""label"": ""Quality of Life"", ""value"": ""Quality of Life"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Abdominal Pain"", ""value"": ""Abdominal Pain"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,Flavia di Michele,Current medicinal chemistry,2022,"Journal Article, Review","

However, its response to external intervention is complex. A previous study showed that the response to Clostridium butyricum (CB) treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is heterogeneous. We proposed that mathematical model simulation of the microbiota may help to optimize the management of IBS-associated microbiota. In this study, a novel mathematical non-extinction and defecation normalized (NEDN) model was generated for stable simulation of the dynamic nature of gut microbiota. In silico simulation revealed that a laxative may create a favourable opportunity for Clostridium cluster XIVa to shift the microbiota. An explorative clinical trial was conducted to compare three CB regimens in an IBS cohort: laxative, interval of 2¬†weeks and CB administration for 2¬†weeks (L2P); laxative immediately followed by CB administration (LP) for 2¬†weeks; and CB administration for 2¬†weeks (P). The LP regimen optimally relieved the IBS symptoms and shifted the microbiota closer to those of the healthy subjects during 2¬†weeks of CB intake. These results indicate that integration of biological/mathematical approaches and clinical scenarios is a promising method for management of microbiota. Additionally, the optimal effect of sequential laxative-CB usage for IBS treatment warrants further validation.Clinical trial registration numbers: NCT02254629.Date of registration: October 2, 2014.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Clostridium butyricum, Computer Simulation, Feces, Female, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Laxatives, Male, Middle Aged, Models, Theoretical, Probiotics, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult","[{""label"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""value"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",2020-Nov-09,"Ming Li, Ri Xu, Yan-Qing Li",Scientific reports,2020,"Journal Article, Randomized Controlled Trial, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","

Using a tightly-controlled clinical trial protocol with the highest Jadad score of 5/5, the current trial aimed to demonstrate the efficacy of a 2-strain mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) to improve IBS symptoms. Eighty patients diagnosed with IBS according to Rome III criteria were recruited to a multicentric, double-blind, in parallel groups, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. Patients were provided with a daily dose of two capsules containing either two probiotic strains (5 x 109 cfu/capsule) or placebo for 8 weeks.

Eligible patients were diagnosed with IBS according to Rome III criteria and had abdominal pain (‚â•4 on an 11-point numerical rating scale) on at least 2 days during a 2-week run-in phase. Patients with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, systemic diseases, cancer, autoimmune diseases, with an intake of antipsychotic medications 3 months before study start, or with an intake of systemic corticosteroids within 1 month before study start were excluded. Randomisation was in a 1:1 ratio according to a computer-generated blocked list. Patients, investigators, clinical monitors, project managers, and statisticians were masked to the randomisation. The primary composite endpoint was the combination of at least 30% improvement of abdominal pain and adequate relief of overall IBS symptoms being fulfilled in at least 4 of 8 weeks during treatment. Analysis of the primary endpoint included all randomly assigned patients receiving at least one dose of study medication and who had no severe protocol violation. Safety analysis included all patients who had taken at least one dose of the study medication and was based on frequency and severity of adverse events, laboratory evaluation, and global assessment of tolerability.

The effects of diet seem to be a result of an interaction with the gut bacteria and the gut endocrine cells. The density of gut endocrine cells is low in IBS patients, and it is believed that this abnormality is the direct cause of the symptoms seen in IBS patients. The low density of gut endocrine cells is probably caused by a low number of stem cells and low differentiation progeny toward endocrine cells. A low fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharide, and polyol (FODMAP) diet and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) restore the gut endocrine cells to the level of healthy subjects. It has been suggested that our diet acts as a prebiotic that favors the growth of a certain types of bacteria. Diet also acts as a substrate for gut bacteria fermentation, which results in several by-products. These by-products might act on the stem cells in such a way that the gut stem cells decrease, and consequently, endocrine cell numbers decrease.

Vitamin D (VD) may interfere in a plethora of cellular mechanisms, and act directly or indirectly in the regulation of the microbiome, the release of anti-microbial peptides, modulation of the immune system and inflammation processes; which in turn, may positively interfere with the altered gut function. The main purpose of this review was to survey studies involving the impacts of VD on IBS. Area covered: Eligible studies including the term VD and IBS were searched in the MEDLINE-PubMed and EMBASE (2009-2018). VD may act direct or indirectly in the regulation of the gut microbiome, immune response, and psychosocial factors that may be included in the list of IBS triggering factors. Expert opinion: Once VD plays an essential role in many processes associated with IBS, its deficiency may be associated with IBS, and the supplementation could help in the therapeutic approach for this condition. For these reasons, the understanding of the association of VD in IBS is indispensable for the development of new strategies that could improve the quality of life of the patient.","Animals, Bacteria, Dietary Supplements, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Humans, Intestines, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Prognosis, Risk Factors, Vitamin D, Vitamin D Deficiency","[{""label"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""value"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Risk Factors"", ""value"": ""Risk Factors"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"Sandra Maria Barbalho, Ricardo de Alvares Goulart, Adriano Cressoni Ara√∫jo, √âlen Landgraf Guiguer, Marcelo Dib Bechara",Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,2019,"Journal Article, Review","

Patients with glycogen storage disease (GSD) type Ia present with gastrointestinal symptoms such as recurrent abdominal pain, bloating and changes in stool form or frequency, which is clinically difficult to distinguish from IBD. We report the case of a 36-year-old man with GSD type Ia and IBD-like disease. A commercial probiotic (VSL#3¬Æ) was chosen as a nutritional supplement treatment because of its high content of microbial species and strains. Three different tests were performed: normal-dose, no-dose and half-dose tests. The study periods for the normal-dose, no-dose and half-dose tests were 4¬†weeks from the treatment initiation, 72¬†h from the end of the previous period and 4¬†weeks to 6¬†months after the end of the 72-h period, respectively.

The intestinal symptoms were less severe with the half-dose nutritional supplement treatment than with no treatment.

Probiotics play an important role in reducing visceral hypersensitivity in IBS patients. However, the mechanism has not been clearly elucidated. In this study, we investigated the role of nod-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 6 (NLRP6) in Clostridium butyricum-regulated IBS induced by stress. Our results showed that NLRP6 was down-regulated in IBS group colon tissues. In addition, IL-18, IL-1Œ≤, myeloperoxidase (MPO), d-lactic acid (D-LA), and CD172a were up-regulated in the IBS group of colonic mucous. IL-18 and IL-1Œ≤ were also increased after the NLRP6 gene was silenced. Pathological score suggested low inflammation of colonic mucous rather than terminal ileum. Water-avoidance stress (WAS) showed visceral hypersensitivity to colonic distension. However, treatment with Clostridium butyricum reversed these results, exerting a beneficial effect.

Patients were provided with a daily dose of two capsules with two strains of Lactobacilli (5x109cfu/capsule) or placebo for 8 weeks on a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome is to obtain scores of abdominal pain/discomfort assessed with a 100-mm visual analogue scale.

IBS is a substantial burden on both patient health-related quality of life and healthcare costs. Several pathophysiologic mechanisms have been postulated for the occurrence of IBS, including altered gastrointestinal motility, visceral hypersensitivity, changes in gut permeability, immune activation, gut-brain dysregulation, central nervous system dysfunction, and changes in the gut microbiota. Of note, both qualitative and quantitative differences have been observed in the gut microbiota of a population with IBS versus a healthy population. Because of the substantial interest in the gut microbiota and its role as a therapeutic target in IBS, this article provides an overview of specific interventions with the potential to modulate the gut microbiota in IBS, including elimination diets, prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, and nonsystemic antibiotics. Although probiotics and synbiotics are generally well tolerated, differences in the composition and concentration of different bacterial species and inclusion or exclusion of prebiotic components varies widely across studies and has prevented strong recommendations on their use in IBS. For nonsystemic antibiotics, rifaximin is indicated in the United States for the treatment of IBS with diarrhea in adults and has been shown to be efficacious and well tolerated in well-designed clinical trials. Overall, more consistent evidence is needed regarding the efficacy and safety of elimination diets, prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics for the treatment of patients with IBS. Furthermore, additional well-designed studies are needed that examine alterations in the gut microbiota that occur with these interventions and their potential associations with clinical symptoms of IBS.","Anti-Bacterial Agents, Clinical Trials as Topic, Diet, Dietary Supplements, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Prebiotics, Probiotics, Rifamycins, Rifaximin, Synbiotics","[{""label"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""value"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"Lucinda A Harris, Noemi Baffy",Postgraduate medicine,2017,"Journal Article, Review","

Profound alterations in the microbiota accompany IGE yet only 10% of IGE patients progress to PI-IBS. This review explores research linking IGE severity, psychological comorbidity, PI-IBS, and the microbiome in various patient populations. Selective pressures caused by inflammation and increased gastrointestinal motility during gastroenteritis can alter intestinal bacterial phyla including Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. More specifically, classes such as Bacteroides and Clostridia are differentially abundant in many PI-IBS patients. Altered microbiota may perpetuate a cycle of enteric and systemic inflammation, potently activating neural afferent signaling in the enteric nervous system and causing pain and diarrhea in PI-IBS patients. Altered production of microbial metabolites, for example short chain fatty acids, may have enteric and systemic effects on the host. Longitudinal sampling to characterize changes in the microbiota's genetic, metabolic, and transcriptional activities over time from IGE to PI-IBS may enable improved diagnosis and classification of PI-IBS cases into subtypes, allowing for targeted antibiotic, probiotic, and prebiotic treatments. PI-IBS is a heterogenous and largely organic disease marked by specific alterations in functions of the microbiota and is an important model for studying microbial influences on intestinal, neurological, and psychological host functions.","Animals, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Diarrhea, Gastroenteritis, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Inflammation, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Prebiotics, Probiotics","[{""label"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""value"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Diarrhea"", ""value"": ""Diarrhea"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Inflammation"", ""value"": ""Inflammation"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"Ian A Downs, Olga C Aroniadis, Libusha Kelly, Lawrence J Brandt",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,2017,"Journal Article, Review","

The sham diet restricted a similar number of staple and non-staple foods as the low FODMAP diet; the diets had similar degrees of difficulty to follow. Dietary counselling was given to patients in all groups and data on foods eaten and compliance were collected. The incidence and severity of 15 gastrointestinal symptoms and overall symptoms were measured daily for 7 days before the study period; along with stool frequency and consistency.

We assessed brain activation patterns, fecal microbiota, urine metabolome profiles, serum markers of inflammation, neurotransmitters, and neurotrophin levels.</p><p><b>RESULTS</b>:<br>At week 6, 14 of 22 patients in the BL group had reduction in depression scores of 2 points or more on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, vs 7 of 22 patients in the placebo group (P¬†=¬†.04). BL had no significant effect on anxiety or IBS symptoms. Patients in the BL group had a mean increase in quality of life score compared with the placebo group. The fMRI analysis showed that BL reduced responses to negative emotional stimuli in multiple brain areas, including amygdala and fronto-limbic regions, compared with placebo. The groups had similar fecal microbiota profiles, serum markers of inflammation, and levels of neurotrophins and neurotransmitters, but the BL group had reduced urine levels of methylamines and aromatic amino acids metabolites. At week 10, depression scores were reduced in patients given BL vs placebo.</p><p><b>CONCLUSION</b>:<br>In a placebo-controlled trial, we found that the probiotic BL reduces depression but not anxiety scores and increases quality of life in patients with IBS.

One of the reasons for this paradigm shift is the realization that gut dysbiosis, including small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), causes IBS symptoms. Between 4% and 78% of patients with IBS and 1% and 40% of controls have SIBO; such wide variations in prevalence might result from population differences, IBS diagnostic criteria, and, most importantly, methods to diagnose SIBO. Although quantitative jejunal aspirate culture is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of SIBO, noninvasive hydrogen breath tests have been popular. Although the glucose hydrogen breath test is highly specific, its sensitivity is low; in contrast, the early-peak criteria in the lactulose hydrogen breath test are highly nonspecific. Female gender, older age, diarrhea-predominant IBS, bloating and flatulence, proton pump inhibitor and narcotic intake, and low hemoglobin are associated with SIBO among IBS patients. Several therapeutic trials targeting gut microbes using antibiotics and probiotics have further demonstrated that not all symptoms in patients with IBS originate in the brain but rather in the gut, providing support for the micro-organic basis of IBS. A recent proof-of-concept study showing the high frequency of symptom improvement in patients with IBS with SIBO further supports this hypothesis.","Adult, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Biopsy, Blind Loop Syndrome, Breath Tests, Female, Humans, Intestine, Small, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Male, Middle Aged, Probiotics, Risk Factors","[{""label"": ""Risk Factors"", ""value"": ""Risk Factors"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",2017-Mar-15,"Uday C Ghoshal, Ratnakar Shukla, Ujjala Ghoshal",Gut and liver,2017,"Journal Article, Review","

A randomized, double-blind, three-arm parallel group trial was carried out on 150 IBS-C subjects divided into three groups (F_1, F_2, and F_3). Each group received a daily oral administration of probiotic mixtures (for 60 days) F_1 or F_2 or placebo F_3, respectively. Fecal microbiological analyses were performed by species-specific qPCR to assess the different amount of probiotics. Results. The percentage of responders for each symptom was higher in the probiotic groups when compared to placebo group during the treatment period (t60) and was maintained quite similar during the follow-up period (t90).

The four major therapeutic approaches include: pharmacologic, dietary, psychosocial, and complementary/alternative medicine interventions.Although there is limited evidence for efficacy of pharmacological therapies such as antispasmodics and anti-diarrheals, these may have a role in severe cases. A Cochrane review concluded that only weak evidence exists regarding beneficial effects of pharmacological agents in providing relief from symptoms in functional abdominal pain (AP) in children. Role of antibiotics in treatment of children with IBS remains controversial. Various non-pharmacologic treatments are available for pediatric IBS. In a recent systematic review including 24 studies some evidence was found indicating beneficial effects of partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG), cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnotherapy, and probiotics (LGG and VSL#3).Few randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are available in children. A meta-analysis including 9 trials which tested different probiotics as a treatment for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (FGIDs) in children and adolescents concluded that Lactobacillus GG, Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and VSL#3 significantly increased treatment success.

Antidepressants were found to be efficacious for abdominal pain, but their tolerance may be problematic and the therapeutic effect varied largely between trials. While meta-analyses suggest efficacy of probiotics as a group, the quality of the trials is often suboptimal and there is large variability. Lubiprostone, a chloride channel activator, and linaclotide, a guanylyl cyclase-C agonist, showed favorable effects on multiple symptoms in IBS with constipation. For IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ramosetron showed efficacy in men and women, but is currently only approved in Japan. A multicenter study with the anti-emetic 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron showed efficacy on stool pattern in IBS-D. The poorly absorbable antibiotic rifaximin and eluxadoline, a mu opioid receptor agonist and delta antagonist, both showed efficacy in phase III trials in IBS-D and were approved by the FDA. Eluxadoline was associated with increased occurrence of sphincter of Oddi spasm and biliary pancreatitis. The non-pharmacological treatment of IBS, with dietary interventions (mainly gluten elimination and low FODMAP (fructose, oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols)) has received a lot of attention lately. While responder rates vary across studies, perhaps based on regional variations in dietary intake of FODMAPs, the dietary approach seems to have acquired recognition as a valid therapeutic alternative.

Both conditions are included among the functional bowel disorders, and have a significant personal, healthcare, and social impact, affecting the quality of life of the patients who suffer from them. The first one is the irritable bowel syndrome subtype, where constipation represents the predominant complaint, in association with recurrent abdominal pain, bloating, and abdominal distension. Constipation is characterized by difficulties with or low frequency of bowel movements, often accompanied by straining during defecation or a feeling of incomplete evacuation. Most cases have no underlying medical cause, and are therefore considered as a functional bowel disorder. There are many clinical and pathophysiological similarities between both disorders, and both respond similarly to commonly used drugs, their primary difference being the presence or absence of pain, albeit not in an ""all or nothing"" manner. Severity depends not only upon bowel symptom intensity but also upon other biopsychosocial factors (association of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms, grade of involvement, and perception and behavior variants). Functional bowel disorders are diagnosed using the Rome criteria. This Clinical Practice Guideline has been made consistent with the Rome IV criteria, which were published late in May 2016, and discuss alarm criteria, diagnostic tests, and referral criteria between Primary Care and gastroenterology settings.

The synbiotic product contained Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5, Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis BB-12, Streptococcus thermophilus, and dietary fiber (90% inulin, 10% oligofructose), and a heat-treated fermented milk without probiotic bacteria or dietary fiber served as placebo. Stool samples were collected after a run-in period, a 4-wk consumption period, and a 1-wk follow-up period, and were subjected to real-time PCR and 16S rDNA profiling by next-generation sequencing. After 4wk of synbiotic (11 subjects) or placebo (19 subjects) consumption, a greater increase in DNA specific for L. acidophilus La-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis was detected in the feces of the synbiotic group compared with the placebo group by quantitative real-time PCR. After 1wk of follow-up, the content of L. acidophilus La-5 and B. animalis ssp. lactis decreased to levels close to initial levels. No significant changes with time or differences between the groups were observed for Lactobacillus, Enterobacteriaceae, Bifidobacterium, or all bacteria. The presence of viable BB-12- and La-5-like bacteria in the feces resulting from the intake of synbiotic product was confirmed by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR. At the end of consumption period, the feces of all subjects assigned to the synbiotic group contained viable bacteria with a BB-12-like RAPD profile, and after 1wk of follow-up, BB-12-like bacteria remained in the feces of 87.5% of these subjects. The presence of La-5-like colonies was observed less frequently (37.5 and 25% of subjects, respectively). Next-generation sequencing of 16S rDNA amplicons revealed that only the percentage of sequences assigned to Strep. thermophilus was temporarily increased in both groups, whereas the global profile of the fecal microbiota of patients was not altered by consumption of the synbiotic or placebo.

This review describes the role of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBS and how dietary strategies to manage symptoms impact on the microbial community. Evidence suggests a dysbiosis of the luminal and mucosal colonic microbiota in IBS, frequently characterised by a reduction in species of Bifidobacteria which has been associated with worse symptom profile. Probiotic supplementation trials suggest intentional modulation of the GI microbiota may be effective in treating IBS. A smaller number of prebiotic supplementation studies have also demonstrated effectiveness in IBS whilst increasing Bifidobacteria. In contrast, a novel method of managing IBS symptoms is the restriction of short-chain fermentable carbohydrates (low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet). Studies consistently demonstrate clinical effectiveness of the low FODMAP diet in patients with IBS. However, one unintentional consequence of this dietary intervention is its impact on the microbiota. This leads to an interesting paradox; namely, increasing luminal Bifidobacteria through probiotic supplementation is associated with a reduction in IBS symptoms while in direct conflict to this, the low FODMAP diet has clinical efficacy but markedly reduces luminal Bifidobacteria concentration. Given the multifactorial aetiology of IBS, the heterogeneity of symptoms and the complex and diverse nature of the microbiome, it is probable that both interventions are effective in patient subgroups. However combination treatment has never been explored and as such, presents an exciting opportunity for optimising clinical management, whilst preventing potentially deleterious effects on the GI microbiota.","Diet, Disaccharides, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Meta-Analysis as Topic, Monosaccharides, Observational Studies as Topic, Oligosaccharides, Polymers, Prebiotics, Probiotics, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","[{""label"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""value"": ""Gastrointestinal Microbiome"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"Heidi M Staudacher, Kevin Whelan",The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2016,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review","

As a correlate, manipulation of gut microbiota represents a new strategy for the treatment of this multifactorial disease. A number of attempts have been made to modulate the gut bacterial composition, following the idea that expansion of bacterial species considered as beneficial (Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria) associated with the reduction of those considered harmful (Clostridium, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella and Pseudomonas) should attenuate IBS symptoms. In this conceptual framework, probiotics appear an attractive option in terms of both efficacy and safety, while prebiotics, synbiotics and antibiotics still need confirmation.

The presence of small intestinal bowel overgrowth (SIBO) has been documented in patients with IBS and reductions in SIBO as determined by breath testing correlate with IBS symptom improvement in clinical trials. The incidence of new onset IBS symptoms following acute infectious gastroenteritis also suggests an infectious cause. Alterations in microbiota-host interactions may compromise epithelial barrier integrity, immune function, and the development and function of both central and enteric nervous systems explaining alterations in the brain-gut axis. Clinical evidence from treatment trials with both probiotics and antibiotics also support this etiology. Probiotics appear to restore the imbalance in the microflora and improve IBS-specific quality of life. Antibiotic trials with both neomycin and rifaximin show improvement in global IBS symptoms that correlates with breath test normalization in diarrhea-predominant patients.

Since a wide variety of probiotic preparations has been used, and despite a large number of studies performed, a great deal of heterogeneity exists among them. Straightforward evidence-based recommendations for the use of probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease have thus been difficult to formulate. In an effort to improve understanding of the risk-benefit balance of probiotics in these conditions, this study (1) queried the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database for all reported adverse drug events related to probiotics in 2013, and (2) constructed risk-benefit planes for both irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease using a geometric approximation of the confidence region between risk and benefit. The results show that adverse events from probiotics vary widely by disease, and when they occur, they are mild and may be difficult to distinguish from the natural history of the underlying disorders they are used to treat. The risk-benefit plane for irritable bowel syndrome straddles the risk-benefit threshold, so patients can expect a balance between a low chance of risk and also a low chance of benefit. The risk-benefit plane for inflammatory bowel disease largely lies above the risk-benefit threshold, so patients may expect more benefit than risk in most cases.

It has a profound effect on quality of life for many patients and poses a substantial cost to society. Due to the complexity and diversity of IBS, diagnosis and treatment can be challenging. Common drawbacks in diagnosing and treating this disorder include unnecessary tests, failure to establish trust in the physician-patient relationship and difficulties in explaining the diagnosis.

A concise diagnostic evaluation, guided adequate information, prompt initiation of symptom-guided treatment and consistency in the patient-doctor relationship can help relieve the suffering experienced by patients with IBS. For patients with mild symptoms, reassurance, education, lifestyle changes and dietary advice are often sufficient. Patients with moderate to severe symptoms might need symptom modifying drugs, and psychological treatments such as CBT or hypnotherapy may be offered at this stage. For patients with severe and incapacitating symptoms, a multidisciplinary approach is recommended and psychotropic drugs are often used.

Clinical studies supporting a role for probiotics in the management of IBS predated such experimental data, and randomized controlled trials of probiotics in IBS continue to be reported. Their interpretation is hampered by the less than optimal quality of many studies; nevertheless, it is apparent that probiotics, as a category, do exert significant effects in IBS. Defining the optimal strain, dose, formulation, and duration of therapy is more challenging given the limitations of available data. There is also an urgent need for appropriately powered and rigorously designed clinical trials of appropriate duration of probiotics in IBS; such studies should also help to define those who are most likely to respond to probiotics.

The use of fiber in treatment of IBS is well established, but recent reviews have shown conflicting evidence. The aim of our review was to study the effects of fiber (soluble and insoluble) on the symptoms of IBS. Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, CINAHL, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for appropriate studies. Two reviewers screened the title/abstract and full text against the inclusion criterion - that is, randomized control trials/crossover studies that compare fiber with placebo for its effect on IBS in an outpatient setting. Independent double data extraction was performed across multiple fields. An assessment of the risk of bias and tests for heterogeneity were carried out, along with a meta-analysis of the outcomes of interest. The search yielded 4199 unique records: 121 were selected after title/abstract screening and 22 after full screening. There was moderate clinical, methodological, and statistical heterogeneity across studies, with a moderate risk of bias. Overall, there was a significant improvement in global assessment of symptoms among those randomized to fiber [risk ratio: 1.27; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05-1.54]. Soluble fiber improved assessment of symptoms (risk ratio 1.49; 95% CI: 1.09-2.03), as well as the abdominal pain score (mean difference: -1.84; 95% CI: -2.72 to -0.97), with insoluble fiber not showing improvement in any outcome.

This review aimed at presenting the recent developments concerning the role of diet in the pathophysiology and management of IBS. There is no convincing evidence that IBS patients suffer from food allergy/intolerance, and there is no evidence that gluten causes the debated new diagnosis of non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). The component in wheat that triggers symptoms in NCGS appears to be the carbohydrates. Patients with NCGS appear to be IBS patients who are self-diagnosed and self-treated with a gluten-free diet. IBS symptoms are triggered by the consumption of the poorly absorbed fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) and insoluble fibre. On reaching the distal small intestine and colon, FODMAPS and insoluble fibre increase the osmotic pressure in the large-intestine lumen and provide a substrate for bacterial fermentation, with consequent gas production, abdominal distension and abdominal pain or discomfort. Poor FODMAPS and insoluble fibres diet reduces the symptom and improve the quality of life in IBS patients. Moreover, it changes favourably the intestinal microbiota and restores the abnormalities in the gastrointestinal endocrine cells. Five gastrointestinal endocrine cell types that produce hormones regulating appetite and food intake are abnormal in IBS patients. Based on these hormonal abnormalities, one would expect that IBS patients to have increased food intake and body weight gain. However, the link between obesity and IBS is not fully studied.

Few and disappointing data are available for prebiotics. A few controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics are instead available with favourable effects, although most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size. A recent report from the Rome foundation group included 32 RCTs of probiotics, most of which showed an overall modest improvement in symptoms, with the patients most benefitting from probiotics being those with predominant diarrhoea and those having a post-infectious IBS. A review focusing only on children with functional gastrointestinal disorders concluded that probiotics are more effective than placebo in the treatment of patients with abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders, although no effect on constipation was evident. The role for probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) appears logical: the endogenous intestinal microbiota plays a central role in their development, and various probiotics have been found effective in animal models of IBD. However, research in humans has been overall quite limited, and it would seem that after a phase of intense research in the first decade of this century, the pace has slowed down, with fewer clinical trials been published in the past 2-3 years. To summarize current evidence: no probiotic has proven successful in Crohn's disease. In ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, data are more promising, and a very recent meta-analysis, that included 23 randomized controlled trials, concluded that there is evidence of efficacy for the probiotic mixture VSL#3 in helping inducing and maintaining remission, as well as in maintaining remission in patients with pouchitis.

Most studies about EcN has been devoted to this organism efficacy in ulcerative colitis treatment. Comparable results were obtained, by citied authors, in the treatment (sustaining remission) of EcN and mesalazine in ulcerative colitis. Moreover, this probiotic therapy, compared to placebo, contributes to obtaining a faster remission and improvement of intestinal histopathology. The use of EcN in Crohn's disease has not been the subject of as many studies as in the case of ulcerative colitis. Assessing the importance of EcN in treatment of other gastrointestinal disorders, authors of the studies observed, that in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, who receiving this probiotic there was a pain, nausea and bloating reduction. In studies conducted among children a positive impact of EcN in prevention and treatment of diarrhea was demonstrated. Similar results were obtained in studies conducted in experimental animals.

Data analysis indicated that stress protocols did not affect plasma tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Œ±), interferon gamma (IFN-Œ≥) and interleukin (IL)-6 levels in young offspring (PND 24) born to the vehicle-treated dams. Maternal probiotic intervention was associated with significantly decreased IFN-Œ≥ levels in young offspring compared with non-probiotic offspring (P‚â§0.05). It also induced a significant increase in IL-6 levels in MS pups (P‚â§0.05). Exposure of both non-MS and MS offspring to AS induced a significant increase in haptoglobin levels compared to controls (P‚â§0.05), whereas all offspring born to the probiotic-treated dams, irrespective of stress treatment conditions, exhibited significantly decreased haptoglobin levels to well below the control levels (P‚â§0.05).

IBS is a functional gut disease with high prevalence and negative impact on patient's quality of life characterized mainly by visceral pain and/or discomfort, representing a good paradigm of chronic gut hypersensitivity. The IBS features are strongly regulated by bidirectional gut-brain interactions and there is increasing evidence for the involvement of gut bacteria and/or their metabolites in these features, including visceral pain. Further, gut microbiota modulation by antibiotics or probiotics has been promising in IBS.

Traditionally, IBS is frequently regarded as a trivial condition which is certainly not life threatening and mainly psychological in origin. However, these preconceptions are misplaced, as in some patients the condition can be devastating with the pain being as severe as that of childbirth coupled with incapacitating bowel dysfunction. In addition, patients suffer from a variety of non-colonic symptoms such as low backache, constant lethargy, nausea and genito-urinary problems, all of which lead to these patients having extremely poor quality of life. Unfortunately, the treatment of IBS is very unsatisfactory with only one new medication being developed for this condition in the last 25 years. It is now recognised that IBS is a multifactorial condition with symptoms being triggered by a variety of factors, some of which appear to be influenced by probiotics, resulting in speculation that they may have therapeutic potential in this condition. There have been over thirty controlled clinical trials of probiotics in IBS with approximately two-thirds of these studies showing evidence of an improvement in symptoms. However, not all probiotics appear to be effective with different symptoms being improved by different strains and some improving symptoms more than others. Consequently, the ideal probiotic for the treatment of IBS has yet to be defined, but the evidence is good enough to encourage further research with the aim of identifying an optimal strain or strains.","Gastrointestinal Tract, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Microbiota, Probiotics, Quality of Life, Treatment Outcome","[{""label"": ""Microbiota"", ""value"": ""Microbiota"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Gastrointestinal Tract"", ""value"": ""Gastrointestinal Tract"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Quality of Life"", ""value"": ""Quality of Life"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"Antonieta R Santos, P J Whorwell",The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2014,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review","

Its pathogenesis is multifactorial: visceral hypersensitivity, dysmotility, psychosocial factors, genetic or environmental factors, dysregulation of the brain-gut axis, and altered intestinal microbiota have all been proposed as possible causes. The human intestinal microbiota are composed of more than 1000 different bacterial species and 10(14) cells, and are essential for the development, function, and homeostasis of the intestine, and for individual health. The putative mechanisms that explain the role of microbiota in the development of IBS include altered composition or metabolic activity of the microbiota, mucosal immune activation and inflammation, increased intestinal permeability and impaired mucosal barrier function, sensory-motor disturbances provoked by the microbiota, and a disturbed gut-microbiota-brain axis. Therefore, modulation of the intestinal microbiota through dietary changes, and use of antibiotics, probiotics, and anti-inflammatory agents has been suggested as strategies for managing IBS symptoms.

It is characterized by chronic abdominal pain, typically associated with altered bowel habits that cannot be explained by structural abnormalities in routine diagnostic workup. Based on the predominant symptom, IBS can be divided into different subtypes: IBS with predominant constipation, diarrhea, bloating, or pain. Knowledge about the complex and multifactorial IBS pathophysiology has increased tremendously in recent years, e.g., IBS may be related to alterations in gastrointestinal motility, visceral sensitivity, and the mucosal immune system. It is important, both for the patient and the physician, that IBS diagnosis is made quickly and thoroughly based on the typical symptom complex and exclusion of relevant differential diagnoses and to reassure the patient that IBS is a chronic, but benign disease. These components are the fundamental basis for a good patient-physician relationship and for a successful long-term management of this potentially very compromising disorder. IBS therapy is based on general measures as well as symptom-oriented medical therapy, where improvement of abdominal pain is one of the main goals in treating IBS patients. Several pain treatment options are available, which may be used long-term or on demand and which may be combined with other therapies. General medical approaches include antispasmodics, improvement of bowel function, phytotherapy, and probiotics. Especially in patients with psychological comorbidities, antidepressants may be used. Modern drug treatments include the GC-C agonist linaclotide in IBS with predominant constipation, the locally acting antibiotic rifaximin in IBS with bloating, and 5-HT3 antagonists in IBS with predominant diarrhea.

It is defined by the Rome III criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders. It is characterized by abdominal pain that is improved by defecation and whose onset is associated with a change in stool form and or frequency and is not explained by structural or biochemical abnormalities. It is estimated that 10%-15% of older children and adolescents suffer from IBS. IBS can be considered to be a brain-gut disorder possibly due to complex interaction between environmental and hereditary factors. The diagnosis of IBS is made based on the Rome III criteria together with ruling out organic causes of RAP in children such as inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. Once the diagnosis of IBS is made, it is important to explain to the parents (and children) that there is no serious underlying disease. This reassurance may be effective treatment in a large number of cases. Lifestyle modifications, stress management, dietary interventions and probiotics may be beneficial in some cases.

We review the evidence for the current and future non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment options targeting the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. Cognitive interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy and hypnotherapy have demonstrated excellent results in IBS patients, but the limited availability and labor-intensive nature limit their routine use in daily practice. In patients who are refractory to first-line therapy, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are both effective to obtain symptomatic relief, but only TCAs have been shown to improve abdominal pain in meta-analyses. A diet low in fermentable carbohydrates and polyols (FODMAP) seems effective in subgroups of patients to reduce abdominal pain, bloating, and to improve the stool pattern. The evidence for fiber is limited and only isphagula may be somewhat beneficial. The efficacy of probiotics is difficult to interpret since several strains in different quantities have been used across studies. Antispasmodics, including peppermint oil, are still considered the first-line treatment for abdominal pain in IBS. Second-line therapies for diarrhea-predominant IBS include the non-absorbable antibiotic rifaximin and the 5HT3 antagonists alosetron and ramosetron, although the use of the former is restricted because of the rare risk of ischemic colitis. In laxative-resistant, constipation-predominant IBS, the chloride-secretion stimulating drugs lubiprostone and linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase C agonist that also has direct analgesic effects, reduce abdominal pain and improve the stool pattern.","Abdominal Pain, Animals, Antidepressive Agents, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Diarrhea, Humans, Hypnosis, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Parasympatholytics, Probiotics","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Abdominal Pain"", ""value"": ""Abdominal Pain"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Diarrhea"", ""value"": ""Diarrhea"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"Tim Vanuytsel, Jan F Tack, Guy E Boeckxstaens",Journal of gastroenterology,2014,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review","

Twin and family aggregation studies suggest a genetic component that does not exclusively explain the higher prevalence of IBS in certain families. Social learning (environmental factors) and maladaptive coping predispose children to develop IBS with greater disability and more frequent medical consultations. Early-life events constitute an additional risk factor for the development of IBS and other functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). Children with a history of cow's milk protein hypersensitivity or abdominal surgeries have a higher prevalence of IBS and other FGIDs years later.

Among the putative pathogeneses, gut dysmotility results in pain and disturbed defecation. The latter is probably caused by the effect of abnormal gut water secretion. The interaction between abnormal gas accumulation, abdominal pain and bloating remains controversial. Visceral hypersensitivity and its modification along with the central transmission are the characteristics of IBS patients. The identification of biologic markers based on genetic polymorphisms is undetermined. Imbalanced gut microbiota may alter epithelial permeability to activate nociceptive sensory pathways which in turn lead to IBS. Certain food constituents may exacerbate bowel symptoms. The impact of adult and childhood abuses on IBS is underestimated. Using the concept of biopsychosocial dysfunction can integrate multidimensional pathogeneses. Antispasmodics plus stool consistency modifiers to treat the major symptoms and defecation are the first-line drug treatment. New drugs targeting receptors governing bowel motility, sensation and secretion can be considered, but clinicians must be aware of their potential serious side effects. Psychiatric drugs and modalities may be the final options for treating intractable subjects. Probiotics of multi-species preparations are safe and worth to be considered for the treatment.

Melatonin plays an important part in gastrointestinal physiology which includes regulation of gastrointestinal motility, local anti-inflammatory reaction as well as moderation of visceral sensation. Melatonin is commonly given orally. It is categorized by the United States Food and Drug Administration as a dietary supplement. Melatonin treatment has an extremely wide margin of safety though it may cause minor adverse effects, such as headache, rash and nightmares. Melatonin was touted as a potential effective candidate for IBS treatment. Putative role of melatonin in IBS treatment include analgesic effects, regulator of gastrointestinal motility and sensation to sleep promoter. Placebo-controlled studies in melatonin suffered from heterogeneity in methodology. Most studies utilized 3 mg at bedtime as the standard dose of trial. However, all studies had consistently showed improvement in abdominal pain, some showed improvement in quality of life of IBS patients.

It is a multifactorial disorder. Intestinal microbiota may cause the pathogenesis of IBS by contributing to abnormal gastrointestinal motility, low-grade inflammation, visceral hypersensitivity, communication in the gut-brain axis, and so on. Previous attempts to identify the intestinal microbiota composition in IBS patients have yielded inconsistent and occasionally contradictory results. This inconsistency may be due to the differences in the molecular techniques employed, the sample collection and handling methods, use of single samples that are not linked to fluctuating symptoms, or other factors such as patients' diets and phenotypic characterizations. Despite these difficulties, previous studies found that the intestinal microbiota in some IBS patients was completely different from that in healthy controls, and there does appear to be a consistent theme of Firmicutes enrichment and reduced abundance of Bacteroides. Based on the differences in intestinal microbiota composition, many studies have addressed the roles of microbiota-targeted treatments, such as antibiotics and probiotics, in alleviating certain symptoms of IBS. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the associations between intestinal microbiota and IBS as well as the possible modes of action of intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBS. Improving the current level of understanding of host-microbiota interactions in IBS is important not only for determining the role of intestinal microbiota in IBS pathogenesis but also for therapeutic modulation of the microbiota.","Animals, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Bacteria, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Humans, Intestines, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Microbiota, Probiotics, Treatment Outcome","[{""label"": ""Microbiota"", ""value"": ""Microbiota"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",2014-Mar-14,"Sung Noh Hong, Poong-Lyul Rhee",World journal of gastroenterology,2014,"Journal Article, Review","

It is characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort, and is associated with changes in stool frequency and/or consistency. The etiopathogenesis of IBS may be multifactorial, as is the pathophysiology, which is attributed to alterations in gastrointestinal motility, visceral hypersensitivity, intestinal microbiota, gut epithelium and immune function, dysfunction of the brain-gut axis or certain psychosocial factors. Current therapeutic strategies are often unsatisfactory. There is now increasing evidence linking alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiota and IBS. Probiotics are living organisms which, when ingested in certain numbers, exert health benefits beyond inherent basic nutrition. Probiotics have numerous positive effects in the gastrointestinal tract. Recently, many studies have suggested that probiotics are effective in the treatment of IBS. The mechanisms of probiotics in IBS are very complex.

The gut is germ-free at birth, but rapidly becomes host to various bacteria establishing a progressively mutual relationship. The composition of gut microbiota is individual-specific and depends on the genotype of the host and environmental factors. Novel techniques have been used to characterize gastrointestinal microbiota, including genomic approaches. The bacterial profile shows that dominant and minor phyla are present in the gastrointestinal tract. From the proximal to the distal segments of the gut the bacterial density gradually increases, reaching an estimated 10(11) to 10(12) bacteria per gram of colonic content. Dynamic interactions between gut and microbiota play a physiological role in metabolic, protective and structural functions, while dysbiosis contributes to several diseases. Microbiota appear to play a role in IBS, where qualitative and quantitative changes of bacteriaoccur in IBS subtypes. Initial therapeutic approaches in IBS have focused on microbiota.

Meta-analyses have indicated effect of probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, few long-term trials have been conducted and uncertainty remains as to effectiveness and long-term effect in a primary care setting. We aimed to investigate the effect of probiotics compared with placebo in the management of IBS in primary care during a 6-month treatment period and with a 6-month follow-up. MATERIAL AND METHODS. We randomized IBS patients fulfilling Rome III criteria to receive two capsules twice daily either containing placebo or a probiotic mixture of Lactobacillus paracasei ssp paracasei F19, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium Bb12 in an amount of 1.3 √ó 10(10) CFU per capsule. Primary endpoint was proportion of responders defined as patients reporting adequate relief (AR) at least 50% of the time in the 6-month treatment period. Secondary outcomes were proportions of patients reporting AR at different time points, and change in gastrointestinal symptoms and health-related quality of life (HrQOL) from baseline to 6 and 12 months. RESULTS. A total of 131 patients were included in this study. The proportion of responders in the treatment period was 52% (35/67) in the probiotic group versus 41% (26/64) in the placebo group, p = 0.18. Overall we found no difference between the groups in change in gastrointestinal symptoms after treatment.

Potential GI colonization by B. infantis 35624 or effects of supplementation on resident GI microbiota may pertain to these clinical observations. In this study, fecal excretion of B. infantis 35624 before, during and after 8 weeks of daily treatment was compared in subjects with IBS who received either the encapsulated oral supplement (n = 39) or placebo (n = 37) and in healthy subjects who received the supplement (n = 41). Secondarily, changes in assessed fecal microbiota and IBS symptoms were determined. Supplementation significantly increased fecal B. infantis 35624 excretion vs. placebo in IBS subjects; excretion in healthy subjects receiving supplement was quantitatively similar. Fecal levels of the probiotic declined and approached baseline once dosing ceased, documenting that colonization is transient. Although supplementation increased numbers of B infantis 35624 within the GI tract, limited changes in 10 other fecal taxa were observed either in healthy subjects or those with IBS. No impact on IBS symptoms was observed. Detection of bacterial DNA in fecal samples suggests that the probiotic is able to survive transit through the GI tract, although strain selective culture techniques were not performed to confirm viability of B. infantis 35624 in the feces. Continuous probiotic administration was necessary to maintain steady-state transit. Given the complex spectrum of GI microbiota, however, monitoring perturbations in selected taxa may not be not a useful indicator of probiotic function.","Adult, Aged, Bifidobacterium, Biota, Double-Blind Method, Feces, Female, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Male, Middle Aged, Placebos, Probiotics, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"Duane Charbonneau, Roger D Gibb, Eamonn M M Quigley",Gut microbes,2013,"Journal Article, Randomized Controlled Trial, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","

They act through diverse mechanisms affecting the composition or function of the commensal microbiota and by altering host epithelial and immunological responses. Certain probiotic interventions have shown promise in selected clinical conditions where aberrant microbiota have been reported, such as atopic dermatitis, necrotising enterocolitis, pouchitis and possibly irritable bowel syndrome. However, no studies have been conducted that can causally link clinical improvements to probiotic-induced microbiota changes. Whether a disease-prone microbiota pattern can be remodelled to a more robust, resilient and disease-free state by probiotic administration remains a key unanswered question. Progress in this area will be facilitated by: optimising strain, dose and product formulations, including protective commensal species; matching these formulations with selectively responsive subpopulations; and identifying ways to manipulate diet to modify bacterial profiles and metabolism.","Colitis, Ulcerative, Colorectal Neoplasms, Crohn Disease, Cross Infection, Diarrhea, Enterocolitis, Necrotizing, Evidence-Based Medicine, Female, Health Status, Humans, Hypersensitivity, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Meta-Analysis as Topic, Probiotics, Vaginitis","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Diarrhea"", ""value"": ""Diarrhea"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"Mary Ellen Sanders, Francisco Guarner, Richard Guerrant, Peter R Holt, Eamonn M M Quigley, R Balfour Sartor, Philip M Sherman, Emeran A Mayer",Gut,2013,"Journal Article, Review","

Of these disorders irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common and affects 10-20% in the Western world. IBS is a functional bowel disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain, discomfort, bloating, and alteration of bowel habits in the absence of any detectable organic cause. Sex and gender aspects are important in understanding differences between men and women in their risk and experience of IBS. Relative to men, women are diagnosed more frequently with IBS. Female patients are more likely to be constipated, complain of abdominal distension and of certain extracolonic symptoms. Given the variability of IBS, the most successful treatment will be comprehensive, involving multiple strategies. Efficacy, safety and tolerability are important in the evaluation of IBS therapies, as patients are likely to require long-term treatment. Laxatives, antidiarrheals or antispasmodics are common in the treatment of IBS but the majority of patients receive antispasmodics followed by prokinetic agents. In treatment of IBS there appears to be a greater clinical response to serotonergic agents developed for IBS in women compared to men. There is an absence of drugs licensed specifically for the treatment of IBS. Further studies with novel agents are needed, to evaluate new approaches to IBS management including gender specific behavioral therapies and better characterization of patient subgroups with regard to drug therapy so that personalized therapy can be tested.","Antidepressive Agents, Antidiarrheals, Benzofurans, Female, Gonadal Steroid Hormones, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Laxatives, Male, Parasympatholytics, Probiotics, Sex Characteristics","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"Ulrike Vo√ü, Anne Lewerenz, Karen Nieber",Handbook of experimental pharmacology,2012,"Journal Article, Review","

Studies particularly suggest an interplay between luminal factors (eg, foods and bacteria residing in the intestine), the epithelial barrier, and the mucosal immune system. Decreased expression and structural rearrangement of tight junction proteins in the small bowel and colon leading to increased intestinal permeability have been observed, particularly in postinfectious IBS and in IBS with diarrhea. These abnormalities are thought to contribute to the outflow of antigens through the leaky epithelium, causing overstimulation of the mucosal immune system. Accordingly, subsets of patients with IBS show higher numbers and an increased activation of mucosal immunocytes, particularly mast cells. Immune factors, released by these cells, including proteases, histamine, and prostanoids, participate in the perpetuation of the permeability dysfunction and contribute to the activation of abnormal neural responses involved in abdominal pain perception and changes in bowel habits. All these mechanisms represent new targets for therapeutic approaches in IBS. Probiotics are an attractive therapeutic option in IBS given their recognized safety and by virtue of positive biological effects they can exert on the host. Of importance for the IBS pathophysiology is that preclinical studies have shown that selective probiotic strains exhibit potentially useful properties including anti-inflammatory effects, improvement of mucosal barrier homeostasis, beneficial effects on intestinal microbiota, and a reduction of visceral hypersensitivity. The effect of probiotics on IBS is positive in most randomized, controlled studies, although the gain over the placebo is small. Identifying tailored probiotic approaches for subgroups of IBS patients represents a challenge for the future.","Abdominal Pain, Bifidobacterium, Gastrointestinal Tract, Humans, Intestinal Mucosa, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Lactobacillus, Mast Cells, Permeability, Probiotics, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","[{""label"": ""Intestinal Mucosa"", ""value"": ""Intestinal Mucosa"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Gastrointestinal Tract"", ""value"": ""Gastrointestinal Tract"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Abdominal Pain"", ""value"": ""Abdominal Pain"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"Giovanni Barbara, Lisa Zecchi, Raffaella Barbaro, Cesare Cremon, Lara Bellacosa, Marco Marcellini, Roberto De Giorgio, Roberto Corinaldesi, Vincenzo Stanghellini",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,2012,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","

We demonstrated that the IBS microbiota is different from that of healthy individuals due to an unbalance in a number of commensal species, with an increase in relative abundance of lactobacilli, B. cereus and B. clausii, bifidobacteria, Clostridium cluster IX and E. rectale, and a decrease in abundance of Bacteroides/Prevotella group and Veillonella genus. Additionally, we demonstrated that some bacterial groups of the human intestinal microbiota, recently defined as pathobionts, are increased in concentration in the IBS microbiota. Furthermore, we aimed at investigating if the daily administration of a novel probiotic yogurt containing B. animalis subsp lactis Bb12 and K. marxianus B0399, recently demonstrated to have beneficial effects in the management of IBS symptoms, could impact on the biostructure of IBS microbiota, modulating its composition to counteract putative dysbiosis found in IBS subjects.

In the IBS subgroup with predominance of diarrhoea only, a clinically relevant decrease in abdominal pain severity score (-36%) was observed with LCR35, whereas no change occurred with placebo. In mixed IBS patients, the 20% and 30% decreases in the IBS severity score observed after treatment with LCR35 and placebo, respectively, were maintained 2 wk later in both groups.

The pathophysiology is complex and multifactorial. In the present review we will focus on the role of intestinal dysbiosis in its pathogenesis and treatment. Post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS) can put light on the mechanisms underlying IBS. Modified commensal gut flora may lead to mucosal inflammation. Several changes such as an increase in mucosal cellularity (enterochromaffin cells, lamina propria T lymphocytes and mast cells), modified pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokine balance and disordered neurotransmission have been observed. The normal microbiota is an essential factor in health. A modification of the flora, such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is thought to play a pathogenic role in IBS. Changes in the composition of the luminal and mucosal colonic flora have been linked to IBS. It is not clear however, whether these changes are a cause or a consequence of the syndrome. The comprehension of the interaction between the dysbiotic microbiota and the host will probably lead to the development of focused therapies. Based on these assumptions, treatments modulating the microbiota have been investigated. On the one hand several probiotics have shown a reduction in IBS symptoms by an immunomodulatory and analgesic effects. On the other hand antibiotic treatment has proven efficacy in treating IBS with or without associated SIBO. Due to its complex pathophysiology, treating IBS nowadays implies multiple approaches, one of which may be modulation of the intestinal flora.","Anti-Bacterial Agents, Humans, Intestines, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Metagenome, Probiotics","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"G Dahlqvist, H Piessevaux",Acta gastro-enterologica Belgica,2011,"Journal Article, Review","

IBS model was induced by intracolonic instillation of 4% acetic acid and restraint stress in rats. After subsidence of inflammation on the seventh experimental day, the rats were subjected to rectal distension, and then the abdominal withdrawal reflex and the number of fecal output were measured, respectively. Also, colonic permeability to Evans blue was measured in vivo, and tight junction protein expression was studied by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting method. Rats had been pretreated with VSL#3 or aminoguanidine (NOS inhibitor) or VSL#3+ aminoguanidine before measurements. The rats at placebo group showed hypersensitive response to rectal distension (P &lt; 0.05) and defecated more stools than control rats (P &lt; 0.05), whereas VSL#3 treatment significantly attenuated VH and effectively reduced defecation. Aminoguanidine reduced the protective effects of VSL#3 on VH.

Many patients seek alternative IBS treatments because of the limitations of conventional treatments. Gwakhyangjeonggisan (GJS), a herbal formula, has long been used for alleviating diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS) in traditional medicine. Duolac7S, which comprises 7 bacterial species as probiotics, has been frequently used for D-IBS.

The assigned treatments will last for 8 weeks. The primary outcomes are adequate relief of IBS pain and discomfort and the proportion of responders (on a weekly basis).

Combinations of drugs to target bothersome symptoms are suggested as the first-line pharmacologic treatment. Increasing knowledge of the pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms of IBS has resulted in the development of several new therapeutic approaches. Thirteen consensus statements for the treatment of IBS were developed using the modified Delphi approach. Exclusion diets have modest efficacy in improving symptoms in some IBS patients. Symptom-based therapies with dietary fiber, bulking agents, laxatives, antispasmodics and laxatives are effective in the improvement of some individual symptoms, e.g. dietary fiber and bulking agents for constipation, laxatives for constipation, antispasmodics for abdominal pain and discomfort, antidiarrheals for diarrhea. 5HT3 receptor antagonists and 5HT((4)) receptor agonists are effective in the relief of global IBS symptoms and individual symptoms such as abdominal pain and abnormal bowel habits. A short term course of nonabsorbable antibiotics may improve global IBS symptoms, particularly in patients with diarrhea- predominant IBS. Some probiotics appear to have the potential benefit in improving global IBS symptoms. Selective C-2 chloride channel activator is more effective than placebo at relieving global IBS symptoms in patients with constipation-predominant IBS. Both tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are equally effective in relieving global IBS symptoms, and have some benefits in treating abdominal pain. Certain types of psychologic therapy may be effective in improving global symptoms in some IBS patients.

IBS is considered a functional bowel disorder (that is, not defined by structural or biochemical abnormalities) and is diagnosed using symptom-based criteria. Limited and judicious use of diagnostic testing is recommended, particularly in patients with typical symptoms of IBS without alarm signs and symptoms. Management of IBS is based on a multifactorial approach and includes establishment of an effective patient-provider relationship, education, reassurance, dietary alterations, pharmacotherapy, behavioral and psychological treatment. Patient-centered care is recommended, in which management is focused on the patient's most bothersome and impactful symptoms, their preferences and previous experiences with treatment, and addressing factors associated with the onset and exacerbation of symptoms. Pharmacotherapy is typically targeted against the predominant symptom. This Review discusses the current evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of IBS. An improved understanding of the recommended diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for IBS will lead to greater patient satisfaction, as well as reduced health-care costs.","Anti-Bacterial Agents, Antidiarrheals, Behavior Therapy, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Laxatives, Probiotics","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"Sarah Khan, Lin Chang",Nature reviews.

Changes in faecal and mucosa-associated microbiota, post-infectious IBS, a link with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and an up-regulation of the GI mucosal immune system all suggest a role for the GI microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBS.

In C-IBS, osmotic laxatives or macrogol are effective to improve colonic transit while loperamide and also colestyramine can be prescribed to reduce the number of stools of D-IBS patients. When the first line treatment fails to improve symptoms, antidepressants (tricyclic rather than SSRs) can be prescribed at lower doses than that recommended for depression. In meta-analysis, the odds ratio for pain relief varies from 2 to 4 and strongly depends on the patient's compliance to the treatment. Probiotics, pregabalin and even antibiotics (i.e neomycin, metronidazole or rifaximin), are possible new therapeutic options. Few clinical trials suggest that ramosetron (a new 5HT3 antagonist), octreotide, melatonin, or lidocain could be also discussed in the future. A non pharmacological therapeutic approach has to be considered, particularly in patients with severe symptoms, in combination with pharmacological treatment.","Abdominal Pain, Analgesics, Anesthetics, Local, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Antidepressive Agents, Central Nervous System Depressants, Diet, Dietary Fiber, Gastrointestinal Agents, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Lidocaine, Melatonin, Octreotide, Parasympatholytics, Pregabalin, Probiotics, Serotonin Antagonists, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Abdominal Pain"", ""value"": ""Abdominal Pain"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,P Ducrott√©,Gastroenterologie clinique et biologique,2009,Journal Article,"

Intestinal infection with Giardia lamblia may lead to therapy-resistant, long-lasting post-giardiasis irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We report two open pilot studies aiming to treat this condition, using either antibiotics or bacterio-therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Twenty-eight patients with persistent abdominal symptoms, following clearance of G. lamblia infection, were investigated. Eighteen received treatment with rifaximin plus metronidazole (8-10 days) whereas 10 received a suspension of live faecal flora, installed into the duodenum during gastro-duodenoscopy. Customary abdominal symptoms and symptoms following a lactulose breath test were quantified by questionnaires. Hydrogen and methane production after lactulose were analysed in expired air and excretion of fat and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was examined in faeces. RESULTS. As compared with pre-treatment values, total customary symptom scores were barely significantly reduced (p = 0.07) after antibiotics, but were highly significantly reduced (p = 0.0009) after bacterio-therapy. However, symptom improvement following bacterio-therapy did not persist 1 year later. Hydrogen breath excretion was slightly reduced after antibiotics, but not after bacterio-therapy. Compared with healthy persons, faecal excretion of fat was significantly increased in Giardia-cured patients. SCFAs were increased in the bacterio-therapy group, and were not influenced by therapy. CONCLUSIONS. Both antibiotics and bacterio-therapy were ineffective with respect to cure of post-giardiasis IBS. High faecal excretion of fat and SCFAs suggests that intestinal malabsorption of fat and carbohydrates may play a role in the IBS-like complaints of these patients.","Adolescent, Adult, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Decision Making, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Giardiasis, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Male, Middle Aged, Probiotics, Retrospective Studies, Surveys and Questionnaires, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"Mette Helvik Morken, J√∏rgen Valeur, Elisabeth Norin, Tore Midtvedt, Gunnar Nysaeter, Arnold Berstad",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,2009,"Comparative Study, Journal Article","

An etiopathogenic approach at last?,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional digestive disorder, and may affect 11-20% of the adult population in industrialized countries. In accordance with Rome III criteria (2006) IBS involves abdominal pain and bowel habit disturbance, which are not explained by structural or biochemical abnormalities. Several hypotheses attempt to account for the pathophysiology of IBS, but the etiology still remains uncertain or obscure, perhaps multifactorial. Abnormalities in colonic microflora have recently been suggested in such patients, as has abnormal small-intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), or in particular a significant reduction in the amount of intraluminal Bifidobacteria or Lactobacilli, with consequences like the production of colonic gas, and motility or sensitivity disturbances of the intestinal tract. The disorder is difficult to treat, and the wide spectrum of non-drug and drug treatments shows our ignorance about the cause of the condition. Newer drugs, both pro- and anti-serotonin, have failed to show long-term efficacy or have been withdrawn due to concerns about harmful effects. Recent research has provided increasing support for the idea that disturbances of intestinal microbiota occur in patients with IBS, and that such abnormalities may contribute to IBS symptoms. Studies in Scandinavian countries in the last ten years emphasize the role of probiotics in the modulation of intestinal microbiota, and as a consequence in the regulation of the motility and hypersensitivity of the digestive tract. Although results between studies are difficult to compare because of differences in study design, probiotic dose, strain, and duration of therapy, some studies show symptom improvement. Lactobacilli are found among the normal bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract, and Lactobacillus plantarum (Lp) is one of the species frequently isolated from the human mucosa, which is capable of surviving the low pH of the stomach and duodenum, resisting the effect of bile acids in the upper small intestine when ingested, and temporarily colonizing the gastrointestinal tract by binding to the intestinal and colonic mucosa. Concurrent with colonization by Lp there is a decrease in bacterial groups with gas-producing ability, such as Veillonella spp. and Clostridia spp. Evidence has now accumulated to suggest the efficacy of certain probiotics like Lp299v, which may be capable of bringing about a significant reduction in pain, abdominal distension and flatulence, while increasing health-related quality of life in IBS.","Adult, Bifidobacterium, Clinical Trials as Topic, Clostridioides difficile, Diarrhea, Enterocolitis, Pseudomembranous, Female, Humans, Intestinal Mucosa, Intestines, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Lactobacillus, Male, Prevalence, Probiotics, Spain, Travel, Treatment Outcome","[{""label"": ""Intestinal Mucosa"", ""value"": ""Intestinal Mucosa"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Diarrhea"", ""value"": ""Diarrhea"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,M Bixquert Jim√©nez,Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas,2009,"Comparative Study, Journal Article, Review","

Antispasmodics with marked atropinic effects do not have a favourable risk-benefit balance; (4) Tricylic antidepressants seem to have only modest analgesic effects in this setting. In contrast, their adverse effects are frequent and they have somewhat negative risk-benefit balances.

Recent studies indicate that a diet restricted in fermentable, poorly absorbed carbohydrates, including fructose, fructans (present in wheat and onions), sorbitol, and other sugar alcohols is beneficial, but confirmatory studies are needed. Despite a long history of enthusiastic use, fiber is marginally beneficial. Insoluble fiber may worsen symptoms. Some patients with IBS, especially those with constipation, will improve with increased intake of soluble fiber. Prebiotic fibers have not been adequately tested. Daily use of peppermint oil is effective in relieving IBS symptoms. The usefulness of probiotics in the form of foods such as live-culture yogurt and buttermilk for IBS symptoms is not established. In clinical practice, it is very difficult to establish that a patient's symptoms result from an adverse reaction to food. A double blind placebo-controlled food challenge is the most reliable method, but it is not suitable for routine clinical use.

Although their exact mechanisms of action remain elusive, it is clear that the beneficial properties inherent to each probiotic species are strain specific. Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 ( B infantis 35624; Bifantis, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company, Cincinnati, OH), is a probiotic with unique abilities to reduce intestinal inflammation. Two randomized, controlled trials have validated its efficacy for treating both individual and global IBS symptoms without evidence to suggest an increase in adverse events.

Studies had to provide improvement in abdominal pain or global IBS symptoms as an outcome. Eligibility assessment and data extraction were performed by two independent researchers.

Earlier studies based on classic microbiologic techniques hypothesized the presence of qualitative changes in intestinal microbiota in IBS patients. Recently, studies with molecular techniques have provided evidence of significant changes in microbial profiles in IBS and that the composition may be correlated with certain symptoms reported by patients. Although these studies are far from being exhaustive and conclusive they provide promising results that deserve further investigation. In addition, initial evidence indicated the presence of increased amounts of bacteria in the upper small intestine of IBS patients, a condition know as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. However, the results of these studies have provided contradictory results suggesting that this area requires further work. These qualitative and quantitative changes in intestinal microbiota may induce different effects on the intestinal mucosa including mucosal barrier defects and immune activation which may contribute to symptom generation. Studies in IBS patients have attempted to target changes in intestinal microflora with different therapeutic approaches, such as the use of prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, and nonabsorbable and systemic antibiotics. Overall, the results obtained in probiotic clinical trials suggest some beneficial effect over placebo in the relief of IBS symptoms. However, these results, although encouraging, should be confirmed in larger well-designed, placebo-controlled studies.

In other functional syndromes, data are far from adequate to make recommendations, but there is evidence for efficacy of probiotics in treating individual symptoms such as diarrhea, constipation, and bloating.

It synthesizes antimicrobial substances (bacteriocins), vitamins (PP, B1, B6, B12), it produces a major intestinal nutrient (butyric acid) and interacts in a competitive fashion with the pathogens. Lactobacilli concentration (Gram+, Gram variable, facultative anaerobes) is generally decreased in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. This syndrome has, until recently been considered to be ''functional'', whereas, in fact, it may result from previous enteritis (in up to 31% of patients), featuring a persistent low-grade intestinal inflammation and a reduction in interleukin-10 (IL-10) concentration. Some Lactobacilli strains (e.g. L. paracasei subsp. paracasei) in vitro lead to normalisation of the hypercontractility of the smooth muscle cells. A growing body of clinical findings indicates that some ''genetically stable'' strains of Lactobacilli may be useful in the treatment, even long term, of IBS, and reduce the postoperative infection rate, especially in critically ill patients (orthotopic liver transplant, severe pancreatitis). However, some Lactobacilli, ''not genetically stable'', used in the treatment of neutropenic patients during chemotherapy and in pediatric patients submitted to gastrojejunostomy, have been reported to lead to bacteremia and endocarditis. These effects may be due to transfer of bacteria and genetic material. Therefore, the confirmed genetic stability and the fact that no antibiotic resistance occurs are fundamental requisites for the use of Lactobacilli in certain disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, such as, for instance, IBS. In conclusion, ''genetically stable'' Lactobacilli (L. paracasei subsp. Paracasei F19) have recently become available, representing an exiting new field in clinical studies and for treatment purposes, offering guarantees of safety also for long-term use.

As no curative treatment is available, therapy is aimed at reducing symptoms, often with little success. Because alteration of the normal intestinal microflora has been observed in IBS, probiotics (beneficial microbes taken to improve health) may be useful in reducing symptoms. This paper systematically reviews randomized, controlled, blinded trials of probiotics for the treatment of IBS and synthesizes data on efficacy across trials of adequate quality. PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, NIH registry of clinical trials, metaRegister, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from 1982-2007. We also conducted secondary searches of reference lists, reviews, commentaries, relevant articles on associated diseases, books and meeting abstracts. Twenty trials with 23 probiotic treatment arms and a total of 1404 subjects met inclusion criteria. Probiotic use was associated with improvement in global IBS symptoms compared to placebo [pooled relative risk (RR pooled) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.62-0.94]. Probiotics were also associated with less abdominal pain compared to placebo [RR pooled = 0.78 (0.69-0.88)]. Too few studies reported data on other IBS symptoms or on specific probiotic strains to allow estimation of a pooled RR. While our analyses suggest that probiotic use may be associated with improvement in IBS symptoms compared to placebo, these results should be interpreted with caution, given the methodological limitations of contributing studies. Probiotics warrant further study as a potential therapy for IBS.","Gastrointestinal Tract, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Probiotics, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Research Design, Treatment Outcome","[{""label"": ""Gastrointestinal Tract"", ""value"": ""Gastrointestinal Tract"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",2008-May-07,"Lynne V McFarland, Sascha Dublin",World journal of gastroenterology,2008,"Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S., Review","

Using the MEDLINE database from 1966-October 2007 and manually searching article references for relevant articles and abstracts, we identified 14 blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trials of the effectiveness of probiotics in the treatment of IBS. Of 11 studies in which overall symptom relief was assessed, seven indicated a significant improvement with probiotics versus placebo. Five of eight investigations of abdominal pain and distention revealed a benefit with probiotic use. Four studies demonstrated an improvement in symptomatic flatulence in probiotic treatment groups, whereas one study showed no significant benefit. Four of five studies of the effects of probiotics on colonic transit time revealed a benefit compared with placebo. As probiotics have shown benefit and possess a favorable adverse-effect profile, their use may represent an option for symptom relief in patients with IBS.

Over the years, research has revealed that the bacterial flora in the human gut interact with the bowel in a complex and dynamic relationship and may be responsible for the induction and progression of some of the pathophysiologic aspects of IBS. Probiotics are nonpathogenic bacteria that benefit the host, and the roles they can play in the bacterio-gut relationship provide hope of a safe treatment that would allow for modulation of IBS disease states. Probiotic treatment for IBS has undergone significant exploration, yet the exact therapeutic effects and doses of these beneficial bacteria remain unclear due to the conflicting nature of available evidence.

Both doctors and patients are frustrated by the insidious nature of IBS--a nonlethal disorder that destroys lives, relationships, and careers. Traditional therapies are sometimes effective in mild disease but are often self-limiting because they focus primarily on individual symptoms. A combination of lifestyle and diet modifications, pharmacologic agents, and therapeutic interventions is usually necessary to address the multiple symptoms characteristic of IBS. One of the major advancements in the treatment of patients with IBS has been the development of US Food and Drug Administration--approved serotonergic therapeutics that specifically target the underlying causes of IBS and provide multisymptom relief by improving gastrointestinal function. Although they are controversial, alternative treatment approaches that target normalization of intestinal bacterial microflora may be helpful for some patients in whom intestinal bacterial overgrowth is present. Patients who have co-existing pelvic floor dysfunction may benefit from physical therapy.

To address this, a consensus group of 10 gastroenterologists was formed to develop treatment recommendations. Although constipation may occur as a result of organic disease, the present paper addresses only the management of primary CC or constipation associated with irritable bowel syndrome. The final consensus group was assembled and the recommendations were created following the exact process outlined by the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology for the following areas: epidemiology, quality of life and threshold for treatment; definitions and diagnostic criteria; lifestyle changes; bulking agents and stool softeners; osmotic agents; prokinetics; stimulant laxatives; suppositories; enemas; other drugs; biofeedback and behavioural approaches; surgery; and probiotics. A treatment algorithm was developed by the group for CC and constipation associated with irritable bowel syndrome. Where possible, an evidence-based approach and expert opinions were used to develop the statements in areas with insufficient evidence. The nature of the underlying pathophysiology for constipation is often unclear, and it can be tricky for physicians to decide on an appropriate treatment strategy for the individual patient. The myriad of treatment options available to Canadian physicians can be confusing; thus, the main aim of the recommendations and treatment algorithm is to optimize the approach in clinical care based on available evidence.","Algorithms, Behavior Therapy, Canada, Chronic Disease, Colectomy, Consensus, Constipation, Gastrointestinal Agents, Gastrointestinal Motility, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Practice Guidelines as Topic, Probiotics, Societies, Medical, Treatment Outcome","[{""label"": ""Chronic Disease"", ""value"": ""Chronic Disease"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Gastrointestinal Motility"", ""value"": ""Gastrointestinal Motility"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Constipation"", ""value"": ""Constipation"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"P Par√©, Ronald Bridges, Malcolm C Champion, Subhas C Ganguli, James R Gray, E Jan Irvine, Victor Plourde, Pierre Poitras, Geoffrey K Turnbull, Paul Moayyedi, Nigel Flook, Stephen M Collins",Canadian journal of gastroenterology = Journal canadien de gastroenterologie,2007,"Journal Article, Review","

Advances in our understanding of the gut flora and of its relationship to the host, together with progress in microbiology, molecular biology and clinical research have identified important biological properties for probiotics and demonstrated efficacy in a number of gastrointestinal disorders. The clear delineation of a post-infective variety of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), as well as the description, in a number of studies, of evidence of low-grade inflammation and immune activation in IBS, suggest a role for a dysfunctional relationship between the indigenous flora and the host in IBS and, accordingly, provide a clear rationale for the use of probiotics in this disorder. Other modes of action, including bacterial displacement and alterations in luminal contents, are also plausible.

Here, we have used a Trichinella spiralis (T. spiralis)-induced model of post-infective IBS, and the effects of probiotic bacteria on gut dysfunction have been investigated using a metabonomic strategy. A total of 44 mice were divided into four groups: an uninfected control group and three T. spiralis-infected groups, one as infected control and the two other groups subsequently treated with either Lactobacillus paracasei (L. paracasei) NCC2461 in spent culture medium (SCM) or with L. paracasei-free SCM. Plasma, jejunal wall and longitudinal myenteric muscle samples were collected at day 21 post-infection. An NMR-based metabonomic approach characterized that the plasma metabolic profile of T. spiralis-infected mice showed an increased energy metabolism (lactate, citrate, alanine), fat mobilization (acetoacetate, 3-D-hydroxybutyrate, lipoproteins) and a disruption of amino acid metabolism due to increased protein breakdown, which were related to the intestinal hypercontractility. Increased levels of taurine, creatine and glycerophosphorylcholine in the jejunal muscles were associated with the muscular hypertrophy and disrupted jejunal functions. L. paracasei treatment normalized the muscular activity and the disturbed energy metabolism as evidenced by decreased glycogenesis and elevated lipid breakdown in comparison with untreated T. spiralis-infected mice. Changes in the levels of plasma metabolites (glutamine, lysine, methionine) that might relate to a modulation of immunological responses were also observed in the presence of the probiotic treatment.

We have preliminary evidence that Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 may have utility in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).</p><p><b>OBJECTIVES</b>:<br>This study was designed to confirm the efficacy of the probiotic bacteria B. infantis 35624 in a large-scale, multicenter, clinical trial of women with IBS. A second objective of the study was to determine the optimal dosage of probiotic for administration in an encapsulated formulation.</p><p><b>METHODS</b>:<br>After a 2-wk baseline, 362 primary care IBS patients, with any bowel habit subtype, were randomized to either placebo or freeze-dried, encapsulated B. infantis at a dose of 1 x 10(6), 1 x 10(8), or 1 x 10(10), cfu/mL for 4 wk. IBS symptoms were monitored daily and scored on to a 6-point Likert scale with the primary outcome variable being abdominal pain or discomfort. A composite symptom score, the subject's global assessment of IBS symptom relief, and measures of quality of life (using the IBS-QOL instrument) were also recorded.</p><p><b>RESULTS</b>:<br>B. infantis 35624 at a dose of 1 x 10(8) cfu was significantly superior to placebo and all other bifidobacterium doses for the primary efficacy variable of abdominal pain as well as the composite score and scores for bloating, bowel dysfunction, incomplete evacuation, straining, and the passage of gas at the end of the 4-wk study. The improvement in global symptom assessment exceeded placebo by more than 20% (p &lt; 0.02). Two other doses of probiotic (1 x 10(6) and 1 x 10(10)) were not significantly different from placebo; of these, the 1 x 10(10) dose was associated with significant formulation problems. No significant adverse events were recorded.</p><p><b>CONCLUSIONS</b>:<br>B. infantis 35624 is a probiotic that specifically relieves many of the symptoms of IBS. At a dosage level of 1 x 10(8) cfu, it can be delivered by a capsule making it stable, convenient to administer, and amenable to widespread use.

An understanding that probiotics are heterogeneous, with multiple targets and mechanisms of action, is fundamental to the development of clinical trials.</p><p><b>RECENT FINDINGS</b>:<br>A bidirectional model for the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome is proposed in which gut-driven and brain-driven mechanisms contribute to the genesis of gut dysfunction and symptoms. In-vitro and animal studies have generated most of the mechanistic rationale for the use of probiotics in functional bowel disorders. A MEDLINE search of publications from 1989 to date revealed only eight placebo-controlled clinical trials on the subject of probiotics and irritable bowel syndrome. All these studies suffer from methodologic problems. By contrast, numerous reviews have been published in the past 2 years on this subject.</p><p><b>SUMMARY</b>:<br>Animal research will continue to identify novel targets and elucidate the mechanisms of action of probiotics, thus providing a rational basis for their use in irritable bowel syndrome.

Although most patients do not seek medical help, the disease accounts for huge costs for both patients and health-care systems and worsens significantly patients' quality of life. Diagnosis is based on the identification of symptoms according to Manning, Rome I and Rome II criteria and exclusion of alarm indicators. IBS symptoms overlap with those of coeliac disease, lactose intolerance, food allergies and bile salt malabsorption. The treatment of IBS is centred on an excellent doctor-patient relationship along with drugs targeting the predominant symptom, especially during exacerbations. Current pharmacological remedies are unsatisfactory due to the high number of patients complaining of lack of response and/or symptom recurrence. Although useful in some IBS patients, the validity of psychotherapy deserves further investigation. A wide array of potentially useful drugs are currently under consideration in pre-clinical trials.

More complex combinations of probiotics for therapeutic bacteriotherapy have also recently become available, however the most elaborate mix of human-derived probiotic bacteria is, by definition, the entire fecal flora. Fecal bacteriotherapy uses the complete normal human flora as a therapeutic probiotic mixture of living organisms. This type of bacteriotherapy has a longstanding history in animal health and has been used sporadically against chronic infections of the bowel, especially as a treatment of last resort for patients with severe Clostridium difficile syndromes including recurrent diarrhea, colitis, and pseudomembranous colitis. Encouraging results have also been observed following infusions of human fecal flora in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic constipation.

Objective: we conducted a meta-analysis of all clinical trials to evaluate the associations between vitamin D and irritable bowel disease. Methods: we screened all randomized controlled trials that were published before December 20, 2021 from the following databases: Medline, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Cochrane Central, and Clinical Trial. We used RevMan 5.4.1 and Stata 16.1 to analyze the relevant data. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) was used to report effect sizes. Serum vitamin D concentration, risk of vitamin D deficiency among patients with IBS, Symptom Severity Score (SSS), and Quality of Life (QoL) score are the main endpoint outcomes in this study. Results: data from twelve clinical trials with 1331 IBS patients were included. Patients with IBS have relatively low vitamin D levels in their serum. Vitamin D supplementation improves the Quality of Life (QoL) score but has no significant effect on the Symptom Severity Score (SSS). Conclusions: vitamin D deficiency is associated with the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome.

Although dietary intake has been the focus of previous research, attention to specific nutrients has been rare. We hypothesized that there is an association between the severity of IBS symptoms and the intake of specific food groups and specific nutrients. In this cross-sectional study, 17 human subjects with IBS, as defined according to the Rome II criteria, were recruited. IBS symptoms were recorded on diary cards every evening for 7 days, and an IBS sum score was calculated (range, 0-15). Intake of food was assessed from a food diary kept by the subjects in the same period. Associations between IBS sum score and dietary intake were explored. The daily IBS sum score was 6.43 (range, 3.86- 9.09). Intake of vitamin B‚ÇÜ was the only component of the diet that was significantly associated with the IBS sum score. The median daily intake of vitamin B‚ÇÜ was 0.9 mg/day (range, 0.6-1.5), the recommended daily intake for men and women is 1.6 mg/day or more and 1.2 mg/day or more, respectively.

It synthesizes antimicrobial substances (bacteriocins), vitamins (PP, B1, B6, B12), it produces a major intestinal nutrient (butyric acid) and interacts in a competitive fashion with the pathogens. Lactobacilli concentration (Gram+, Gram variable, facultative anaerobes) is generally decreased in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. This syndrome has, until recently been considered to be ''functional'', whereas, in fact, it may result from previous enteritis (in up to 31% of patients), featuring a persistent low-grade intestinal inflammation and a reduction in interleukin-10 (IL-10) concentration. Some Lactobacilli strains (e.g. L. paracasei subsp. paracasei) in vitro lead to normalisation of the hypercontractility of the smooth muscle cells. A growing body of clinical findings indicates that some ''genetically stable'' strains of Lactobacilli may be useful in the treatment, even long term, of IBS, and reduce the postoperative infection rate, especially in critically ill patients (orthotopic liver transplant, severe pancreatitis). However, some Lactobacilli, ''not genetically stable'', used in the treatment of neutropenic patients during chemotherapy and in pediatric patients submitted to gastrojejunostomy, have been reported to lead to bacteremia and endocarditis. These effects may be due to transfer of bacteria and genetic material. Therefore, the confirmed genetic stability and the fact that no antibiotic resistance occurs are fundamental requisites for the use of Lactobacilli in certain disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, such as, for instance, IBS. In conclusion, ''genetically stable'' Lactobacilli (L. paracasei subsp. Paracasei F19) have recently become available, representing an exiting new field in clinical studies and for treatment purposes, offering guarantees of safety also for long-term use. Careful personalized evaluation, as always in medical practice, is necessary in order to gain further insight into, and to validate with additional studies, the role of ''genetically stable'' Lactobacilli in the treatment of IBS.","Anti-Bacterial Agents, Bacteriocins, Butyric Acid, Evidence-Based Medicine, Gastrointestinal Motility, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Lactobacillus, Probiotics, Quality of Life, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Treatment Outcome, Vitamins","[{""label"": ""Gastrointestinal Motility"", ""value"": ""Gastrointestinal Motility"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Quality of Life"", ""value"": ""Quality of Life"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Nutrients"", ""value"": ""Nutrients"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,L Lombardo,Minerva gastroenterologica e dietologica,2008,"Journal Article, Review","

Moreover, curcumin increased serotonin, BDNF and pCREB levels in the hippocampus, but they were decreased in the colonic of CAS rats. 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist NAN-190 reversed the effects of curcumin on behaviors and the changes of intestine, pCREB and BDNF expression, which are related to IBS. These results suggested that curcumin exerts the effects on IBS through regulating neurotransmitters, BDNF and CREB signaling both in the brain and peripheral intestinal system.","Animals, Anxiety, Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, Colon, Curcumin, Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein, Defecation, Diazepam, Disease Models, Animal, Drug Evaluation, Preclinical, Enteric Nervous System, Gastrointestinal Motility, Hippocampus, Imipramine, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Male, Phosphorylation, Physical Exertion, Piperazines, Pressure, Protein Processing, Post-Translational, Rats, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A, Serotonin, Serotonin 5-HT1 Receptor Antagonists, Signal Transduction, Stress, Physiological, Stress, Psychological, Up-Regulation","[{""label"": ""Colon"", ""value"": ""Colon"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Defecation"", ""value"": ""Defecation"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Enteric Nervous System"", ""value"": ""Enteric Nervous System"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Gastrointestinal Motility"", ""value"": ""Gastrointestinal Motility"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Anxiety"", ""value"": ""Anxiety"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Stress, Psychological"", ""value"": ""Stress, Psychological"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Curcumin"", ""value"": ""Curcumin"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"Yingcong Yu, Shujuan Wu, Jianxin Li, Renye Wang, Xupei Xie, Xuefeng Yu, Jianchun Pan, Ying Xu, Liang Zheng",Metabolic brain disease,2015,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","

This study investigated the impact of dietary guidance on the symptoms, quality of life and habitual diet of patients with IBS. Forty-six patients who fulfilled the Rome III criteria for the diagnosis of IBS were included. Of these patients, 17 completed the entire study. Each patient attended three sessions (~45 min in duration) and received individual guidance on their dietary management. The patients were asked to complete the following questionnaires prior to receiving the dietary guidance, and at least 3 months subsequently: The Birmingham IBS symptom score questionnaire, the IBS Quality of Life (IBS-QOL) questionnaire, the Short-Form Nepean and Dyspepsia Index (SF‚ÄëNDI) and the MoBa Food Frequency Questionnaire (MoBa FFQ). The time at which patients completed the questionnaires following dietary guidance ranged from 3-9 months (median, 4 months). The total IBS symptom scores were reduced once the patients had received dietary guidance (P=0.001). The total score for the quality of life, as assessed by the IBS‚ÄëQOL and the SF-NDI, increased significantly following the dietary guidance sessions (P=0.003 and P=0.002, respectively). There were no statistical differences in the intake of calories, carbohydrate, fiber, protein, fat or alcohol in the patients with IBS following dietary guidance. There were increases in the consumption of dairy products, Œ≤-carotene, retinol equivalents, riboflavin, vitamin B12 and calcium, although only the increase in vitamin B12 consumption was statistically significant. There was a significant reduction in the consumption of certain fruits and vegetables that were rich in highly fermentable short-chain carbohydrates, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, as well as insoluble fibers.

This study investigated the impact of dietary guidance on the symptoms, quality of life and habitual diet of patients with IBS. Forty-six patients who fulfilled the Rome III criteria for the diagnosis of IBS were included. Of these patients, 17 completed the entire study. Each patient attended three sessions (~45 min in duration) and received individual guidance on their dietary management. The patients were asked to complete the following questionnaires prior to receiving the dietary guidance, and at least 3 months subsequently: The Birmingham IBS symptom score questionnaire, the IBS Quality of Life (IBS-QOL) questionnaire, the Short-Form Nepean and Dyspepsia Index (SF‚ÄëNDI) and the MoBa Food Frequency Questionnaire (MoBa FFQ). The time at which patients completed the questionnaires following dietary guidance ranged from 3-9 months (median, 4 months). The total IBS symptom scores were reduced once the patients had received dietary guidance (P=0.001). The total score for the quality of life, as assessed by the IBS‚ÄëQOL and the SF-NDI, increased significantly following the dietary guidance sessions (P=0.003 and P=0.002, respectively). There were no statistical differences in the intake of calories, carbohydrate, fiber, protein, fat or alcohol in the patients with IBS following dietary guidance. There were increases in the consumption of dairy products, Œ≤-carotene, retinol equivalents, riboflavin, vitamin B12 and calcium, although only the increase in vitamin B12 consumption was statistically significant. There was a significant reduction in the consumption of certain fruits and vegetables that were rich in highly fermentable short-chain carbohydrates, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, as well as insoluble fibers. In conclusion, three 45-min dietary guidance sessions, administered by a nurse, reduced the symptoms and improved the quality of life of patients with IBS, and resulted in an adequate intake of vitamins and minerals.

In this cross-sectional study, 17 human subjects with IBS, as defined according to the Rome II criteria, were recruited. IBS symptoms were recorded on diary cards every evening for 7 days, and an IBS sum score was calculated (range, 0-15). Intake of food was assessed from a food diary kept by the subjects in the same period. Associations between IBS sum score and dietary intake were explored. The daily IBS sum score was 6.43 (range, 3.86- 9.09). Intake of vitamin B‚ÇÜ was the only component of the diet that was significantly associated with the IBS sum score. The median daily intake of vitamin B‚ÇÜ was 0.9 mg/day (range, 0.6-1.5), the recommended daily intake for men and women is 1.6 mg/day or more and 1.2 mg/day or more, respectively.

In this study, we investigated whether luteolin inhibits gut inflammation, using in vivo and in vitro inflammation models. In a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model, luteolin (20 and 50 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated shortening of colon length and histological score. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that luteolin also significantly inhibited infiltration of macrophages and interferon (IFN)-Œ≥-producing CD4‚Å∫ T cells into the colonic mucosa. Treatment with luteolin also improved IFN-Œ≥ mRNA expression in the colon. At the cellular level, a co-culture consisting of intestinal epithelial Caco-2 and macrophage RAW264.7 cells, stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, the addition of luteolin (100 ŒºM) suppressed interleukin (IL)-8 mRNA expression in Caco-2 cells without epithelial monolayer disruption. Expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Œ± protein and proinflammatory cytokines mRNA (TNF-Œ±, IL-6, and IL-1Œ≤) in RAW264.7 cells were also suppressed. HPLC analysis and subsequent cellular assay revealed that aglycone of luteolin was present in the basolateral supernatant of this system at a sufficient concentration to suppress TNF-Œ± production and nuclear factor (NF)-Œ∫B activation of RAW264.7 cells. These results suggest that the luteolin aglycones released from the Caco-2 epithelium inhibits NF-Œ∫B nuclear translocation in RAW264.7 cells, followed by reduction of TNF-Œ± mRNA expression, which results in downregulation of IL-8 mRNA expression in Caco-2 cells.

However, clinical treatment of irritable bowel disease with vitamin D is controversial. Objective: we conducted a meta-analysis of all clinical trials to evaluate the associations between vitamin D and irritable bowel disease. Methods: we screened all randomized controlled trials that were published before December 20, 2021 from the following databases: Medline, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Cochrane Central, and Clinical Trial. We used RevMan 5.4.1 and Stata 16.1 to analyze the relevant data. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) was used to report effect sizes. Serum vitamin D concentration, risk of vitamin D deficiency among patients with IBS, Symptom Severity Score (SSS), and Quality of Life (QoL) score are the main endpoint outcomes in this study. Results: data from twelve clinical trials with 1331 IBS patients were included. Patients with IBS have relatively low vitamin D levels in their serum. Vitamin D supplementation improves the Quality of Life (QoL) score but has no significant effect on the Symptom Severity Score (SSS). Conclusions: vitamin D deficiency is associated with the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome. Serum vitamin D levels decreased in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, and vitamin D supplementation could improve patient quality of life.","Dietary Supplements, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Quality of Life, Vitamin D, Vitamin D Deficiency, Vitamins","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Quality of Life"", ""value"": ""Quality of Life"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Vitamins"", ""value"": ""Vitamins"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",2022-Oct-17,"Yang Bin, Liao Kang, Yuan Lili",Nutricion hospitalaria,2022,"Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Systematic Review","

The daily IBS sum score was 6.43 (range, 3.86- 9.09). Intake of vitamin B‚ÇÜ was the only component of the diet that was significantly associated with the IBS sum score. The median daily intake of vitamin B‚ÇÜ was 0.9 mg/day (range, 0.6-1.5), the recommended daily intake for men and women is 1.6 mg/day or more and 1.2 mg/day or more, respectively.

It synthesizes antimicrobial substances (bacteriocins), vitamins (PP, B1, B6, B12), it produces a major intestinal nutrient (butyric acid) and interacts in a competitive fashion with the pathogens. Lactobacilli concentration (Gram+, Gram variable, facultative anaerobes) is generally decreased in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. This syndrome has, until recently been considered to be ''functional'', whereas, in fact, it may result from previous enteritis (in up to 31% of patients), featuring a persistent low-grade intestinal inflammation and a reduction in interleukin-10 (IL-10) concentration. Some Lactobacilli strains (e.g. L. paracasei subsp. paracasei) in vitro lead to normalisation of the hypercontractility of the smooth muscle cells. A growing body of clinical findings indicates that some ''genetically stable'' strains of Lactobacilli may be useful in the treatment, even long term, of IBS, and reduce the postoperative infection rate, especially in critically ill patients (orthotopic liver transplant, severe pancreatitis). However, some Lactobacilli, ''not genetically stable'', used in the treatment of neutropenic patients during chemotherapy and in pediatric patients submitted to gastrojejunostomy, have been reported to lead to bacteremia and endocarditis. These effects may be due to transfer of bacteria and genetic material. Therefore, the confirmed genetic stability and the fact that no antibiotic resistance occurs are fundamental requisites for the use of Lactobacilli in certain disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, such as, for instance, IBS. In conclusion, ''genetically stable'' Lactobacilli (L. paracasei subsp. Paracasei F19) have recently become available, representing an exiting new field in clinical studies and for treatment purposes, offering guarantees of safety also for long-term use. Careful personalized evaluation, as always in medical practice, is necessary in order to gain further insight into, and to validate with additional studies, the role of ''genetically stable'' Lactobacilli in the treatment of IBS.","Anti-Bacterial Agents, Bacteriocins, Butyric Acid, Evidence-Based Medicine, Gastrointestinal Motility, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Lactobacillus, Probiotics, Quality of Life, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Treatment Outcome, Vitamins","[{""label"": ""Gastrointestinal Motility"", ""value"": ""Gastrointestinal Motility"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Quality of Life"", ""value"": ""Quality of Life"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Vitamins"", ""value"": ""Vitamins"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,L Lombardo,Minerva gastroenterologica e dietologica,2008,"Journal Article, Review","

Salicylic acid (SA), a plant hormone involved in plant immune response, is one such bioactive food chemical. Aspirin, a commercially available SA, might play beneficial roles in cardiovascular health and colon cancer. It may also cause urticaria, angioedema, asthma, and gastrointestinal symptoms in SA-sensitive individuals. Dietary SA might exert similar beneficial effects and/or may induce similar symptoms in hypersensitive individuals. Food-related SA sensitivity in relation to gastrointestinal symptoms is not well documented besides a few self-reported questionnaires and the knowledge that low doses of aspirin (equivalent of high dietary intake) can cause gastrointestinal injury. The only direct evidence that suggests benefits of reducing dietary SA was reported in asthmatic individuals. Although SA sensitivity in relation to gut symptoms in susceptible individuals is accepted by clinicians, the detection of this disease remains a challenge because of the complicated nature of dietary challenges and the risk of oral aspirin provocation tests in patients with severe hypersensitivity reactions. Given the non-IgE mediated nature of the disease, in vitro assays like basophil activation may have failed to produce reliable results. However, given the simplicity of this assay, further studies need to be formulated to firmly establish its reliability. Formulation of proper dietary strategies for symptom control is also impossible given the controversial and scant nature of the data on SA content of food.

EHealth by constant-care in IBD and IBS.,"<p><b>BACKGROUND</b>:<br>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are chronic gastrointestinal disorders of unknown aetiology of increasing incidence and changing disease activity or severity. Approximately 60-80% of IBD patients suffer from IBS. Monitoring and treatment goals of IBD are to optimise the disease course by prolonging remission periods and preventing or shortening periods of active disease. Constant-care web-monitoring and treatment approaches with active patient involvement have been proven effective in UC, increasing patients' adherence and improving the disease outcomes.</p><p><b>AIM</b>:<br>To assess the feasibility and efficacy of the novel constant-care eHealth applications in: i) CD patients treated with infliximab (IFX), ii) UC patients with active disease on mesalazine, iii) IBS patients and iv) IBD patients with IBS on a low FODMAP diet (LFD).</p><p><b>METHODS</b>:<br>New constant-care web applications www.cd.constant-care.dk, www.meza.constant-care.dk and www.ibs.constant-care.dk in IBD patients were developed and assessed in this thesis. An integrated inflammatory burden measure of disease activity, consisting of a subjective (clinical indices) and of an objective (faecal calprotectin) part and a treatment guide to drug doses and intervals, was incorporated into the web applications and used by patients.</p><p><b>RESULTS</b>:<br>Web-guided IFX treatment in CD demonstrated patients' inter- and intra-individual variability in infusion intervals and provided patients with individualised treatment according to their needs. Web-guided treatment with multimatrix mesalazine was efficacious in a majority of UC patients with mild-to-moderate disease activity. Web-guided IBS-monitoring in IBD and in IBS patients on LFD was shown to be a feasible method that actively involved patients in their disease management and had a positive short-term impact on the disease. Moreover, the new constant-care concepts were demonstrated to be safe and to have a positive impact on quality of life and adherence to treatment and helped to reduce the costs.</p><p><b>CONCLUSIONS</b>:<br>The novel constant-care web applications have proven feasible in improving the disease outcomes in CD patients on IFX, in UC patients on mesalazine, and in monitoring IBS.

Stress-related psychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety are often comorbid with gastrointestinal function disorder, such as IBS. However, the mechanism of IBS still remains unknown. Curcumin is a biologically active phytochemical presents in turmeric and has pharmacological actions that benefit patients with depression and anxiety. Our study found that IBS rats showed depression- and anxiety-like behaviors associated with decreased 5-HT (serotonin), BDNF (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor) and pCREB (phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein) expression in the hippocampus after chronic acute combining stress (CAS). However, these decreased parameters were obviously increased in the colonic after CAS. Curcumin (40 mg/kg) reduced the immobility time of forced swimming and the number of buried marbles in behavioral tests of CAS rats. Curcumin also decreased the number of fecal output and abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) scores in response to graded distention. Moreover, curcumin increased serotonin, BDNF and pCREB levels in the hippocampus, but they were decreased in the colonic of CAS rats. 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist NAN-190 reversed the effects of curcumin on behaviors and the changes of intestine, pCREB and BDNF expression, which are related to IBS. These results suggested that curcumin exerts the effects on IBS through regulating neurotransmitters, BDNF and CREB signaling both in the brain and peripheral intestinal system.","Animals, Anxiety, Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, Colon, Curcumin, Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein, Defecation, Diazepam, Disease Models, Animal, Drug Evaluation, Preclinical, Enteric Nervous System, Gastrointestinal Motility, Hippocampus, Imipramine, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Male, Phosphorylation, Physical Exertion, Piperazines, Pressure, Protein Processing, Post-Translational, Rats, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A, Serotonin, Serotonin 5-HT1 Receptor Antagonists, Signal Transduction, Stress, Physiological, Stress, Psychological, Up-Regulation","[{""label"": ""Colon"", ""value"": ""Colon"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Defecation"", ""value"": ""Defecation"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Enteric Nervous System"", ""value"": ""Enteric Nervous System"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Gastrointestinal Motility"", ""value"": ""Gastrointestinal Motility"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Anxiety"", ""value"": ""Anxiety"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Stress, Psychological"", ""value"": ""Stress, Psychological"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Phenols"", ""value"": ""Phenols"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"Yingcong Yu, Shujuan Wu, Jianxin Li, Renye Wang, Xupei Xie, Xuefeng Yu, Jianchun Pan, Ying Xu, Liang Zheng",Metabolic brain disease,2015,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","

Patients characteristically have abdominal discomfort and disturbed bowel habit. Diarrhoea-predominant IBS is characterised by frequent loose stools with associated urgency and abdominal cramps. Current symptomatic treatments can reduce bowel frequency but often fail to reduce discomfort.Mesalazine is an anti-inflammatory drug used to treat patients with inflammatory bowel disease. There is one pilot study suggesting it may be beneficial to patients who have diarrhoea-predominant IBS but these findings need to be confirmed in a larger trial. The current study aims to test the effectiveness of mesalazine to reduce symptoms in diarrhoea-predominant IBS patients. The study will also investigate the mode of action of the drug, especially its impact on mast cell activation.</p><p><b>METHODS/DESIGN</b>:<br>This is a multicentre randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial using a parallel group design. At least 108 participants with diarrhoea-predominant IBS will be recruited through at least six hospitals. The intervention is a 12-week course of 2g mesalazine granules taken up to twice a day. The comparator is a blinded placebo granule formulation.Outcome measures include stool diaries, symptom questionnaires, stool and blood samples together with rectal mucosal biopsies. The daily stool diary will record stool frequency and form, urgency, bloating, abdominal pain and a global satisfaction with control of IBS scored each week.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of trimebutine maleate on modulating colonic hypercontractility in a mouse model of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome. Mice infected up to 8 weeks with T. spiralis underwent abdominal withdrawal reflex to colorectal distention to evaluate the visceral sensitivity at different time points. Tissues were examined for histopathology scores. Colonic longitudinal muscle strips were prepared in the organ bath under basal condition or to be stimulated by acetylcholine and potassium chloride, and consecutive concentrations of trimebutine maleate were added to the bath to record the strip responses. Significant inflammation was observed in the intestines of the mice infected 2 weeks, and it resolved in 8 weeks after infection. Visceral hyperalgesia and colonic muscle hypercontractility emerged after infection, and trimebutine maleate could effectively reduce the colonic hyperreactivity. Hypercontractility of the colonic muscle stimulated by acetylcholine and high K(+) could be inhibited by trimebutine maleate in solution with Ca(2+), but not in Ca(2+) free solution. Compared with 8-week postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome group, 2-week acute infected strips were much more sensitive to the stimulators and the drug trimebutine maleate.

The identification of higher counts of immunocytes (e.g. T cells and mast cells), mucosal and systemic immune activation, and increased mucosal permeability in patients with IBS has stimulated interest in the potential development of therapeutic approaches aimed at targeting the immune system and inflammation. Although an initial attempt in a pilot trial with steroids in patients with post-infective IBS failed, there has been renewed interest for mast cell stabilizers and the therapeutic potential of aminosalicylates. A recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial assessed the effect of mesalazine on intestinal immune cells and symptom perception in patients with IBS. Mesalazine markedly reduced mucosal immune cells and mast cells in particular, compared to placebo. In addition, mesalazine significantly improved general well-being. Mesalazine may enhance epithelial barrier function, and preliminary data suggest that it may alter faecal bacterial profiles in IBS patients. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism through which this drug affects immune activation in the intestine of patients with IBS remains unknown.

However, the effect of chili ingestion on gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS patients has not been characterized. To study the effect of chili-containing foods on postprandial gastrointestinal symptoms in diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), 20 IBS-D patients underwent gastrointestinal symptoms and postprandial colonic transit evaluations after ingesting three different meals: (i) a standard meal, (ii) a spicy meal (a standard meal mixed with 2 g chili), and (iii) a standard meal with 2 g chili in capsules, in a randomized crossover fashion. Postprandial gastrointestinal symptoms were scored every 15 min for 2 h using visual analogue scales. Thirty-eight healthy volunteers were used as controls. In healthy volunteers, the spicy meals and meals with chili capsules induced only mild abdominal burning relative to the standard meals (P &lt; 0.05), whereas it induced significant levels of abdominal pain and burning in IBS-D patients (P &lt; 0.05). Other gastrointestinal symptoms and postprandial colonic transit after spicy meals and meals with chili capsules did not differ from standard meals in IBS-D and controls (P &gt; 0.05).

It is now believed that disordered gut function (including abnormalities like disturbances of motility such as postprandial fundic relaxation, gastric emptying and disturbed visceral sensory function) play a key role for the manifestation of these disorders. The underlying pathophysiology is not yet fully understood. However, the available data suggest that a number of factors may contribute to the manifestation of symptoms. These factors include environmental factors such as acute infections as trigger event, psychological stressors that may precede acute exacerbations and a genetic predisposition. Considering the large number of mechanisms, a treatment targeting a single mechanism is unlikely to be effective in all patients. Indeed, chemically defined treatments usually gain a 10-15% superiority over placebo. In recent years placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated superiority of a commercial multicomponent herbal preparation, STW 5, with the trade name Iberogast, for the treatment of patients with functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome. This phytopharmacon is a combination of nine plant extracts each with a number of different active constituents. Pharmacological studies have shown different effects of the single plant extracts on the (molecular) mechanisms which are discussed as underlying the manifestation of symptoms. Various well-controlled clinical trials have independently confirmed clinical efficacy and safety. The clinically efficacy of this multicomponent herbal preparation questions the current trend of highly targeted drug molecules that usually target one single receptor population while it has not been shown that a single receptor group plays a pivotal role for the control of symptoms. Herbal medicines are obtained from various plants and contain complex extracts with a large number of different active substances. While there are only limited head-to-head comparisons with conventional chemically defined medications, the combination of extracts with various gastrointestinal active ingredients appears to be advantageous for a heterogeneous condition such as functional dyspepsia.","Antiemetics, Cisapride, Cohort Studies, Double-Blind Method, Dyspepsia, Gastrointestinal Agents, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Meta-Analysis as Topic, Metoclopramide, Pain, Pharmacoepidemiology, Phytotherapy, Plant Extracts, Product Surveillance, Postmarketing, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Phenols"", ""value"": ""Phenols"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"W R√∂sch, T Liebregts, K-J Gundermann, B Vinson, G Holtmann",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2006,"Journal Article, Review","

However, clinical treatment of irritable bowel disease with vitamin D is controversial. Objective: we conducted a meta-analysis of all clinical trials to evaluate the associations between vitamin D and irritable bowel disease. Methods: we screened all randomized controlled trials that were published before December 20, 2021 from the following databases: Medline, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Cochrane Central, and Clinical Trial. We used RevMan 5.4.1 and Stata 16.1 to analyze the relevant data. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) was used to report effect sizes. Serum vitamin D concentration, risk of vitamin D deficiency among patients with IBS, Symptom Severity Score (SSS), and Quality of Life (QoL) score are the main endpoint outcomes in this study. Results: data from twelve clinical trials with 1331 IBS patients were included. Patients with IBS have relatively low vitamin D levels in their serum. Vitamin D supplementation improves the Quality of Life (QoL) score but has no significant effect on the Symptom Severity Score (SSS). Conclusions: vitamin D deficiency is associated with the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome. Serum vitamin D levels decreased in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, and vitamin D supplementation could improve patient quality of life.","Dietary Supplements, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Quality of Life, Vitamin D, Vitamin D Deficiency, Vitamins","[{""label"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""value"": ""Dietary Supplements"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Quality of Life"", ""value"": ""Quality of Life"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Micronutrients"", ""value"": ""Micronutrients"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",2022-Oct-17,"Yang Bin, Liao Kang, Yuan Lili",Nutricion hospitalaria,2022,"Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Systematic Review","

It synthesizes antimicrobial substances (bacteriocins), vitamins (PP, B1, B6, B12), it produces a major intestinal nutrient (butyric acid) and interacts in a competitive fashion with the pathogens. Lactobacilli concentration (Gram+, Gram variable, facultative anaerobes) is generally decreased in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. This syndrome has, until recently been considered to be ''functional'', whereas, in fact, it may result from previous enteritis (in up to 31% of patients), featuring a persistent low-grade intestinal inflammation and a reduction in interleukin-10 (IL-10) concentration. Some Lactobacilli strains (e.g. L. paracasei subsp. paracasei) in vitro lead to normalisation of the hypercontractility of the smooth muscle cells. A growing body of clinical findings indicates that some ''genetically stable'' strains of Lactobacilli may be useful in the treatment, even long term, of IBS, and reduce the postoperative infection rate, especially in critically ill patients (orthotopic liver transplant, severe pancreatitis). However, some Lactobacilli, ''not genetically stable'', used in the treatment of neutropenic patients during chemotherapy and in pediatric patients submitted to gastrojejunostomy, have been reported to lead to bacteremia and endocarditis. These effects may be due to transfer of bacteria and genetic material. Therefore, the confirmed genetic stability and the fact that no antibiotic resistance occurs are fundamental requisites for the use of Lactobacilli in certain disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, such as, for instance, IBS. In conclusion, ''genetically stable'' Lactobacilli (L. paracasei subsp. Paracasei F19) have recently become available, representing an exiting new field in clinical studies and for treatment purposes, offering guarantees of safety also for long-term use. Careful personalized evaluation, as always in medical practice, is necessary in order to gain further insight into, and to validate with additional studies, the role of ''genetically stable'' Lactobacilli in the treatment of IBS.","Anti-Bacterial Agents, Bacteriocins, Butyric Acid, Evidence-Based Medicine, Gastrointestinal Motility, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Lactobacillus, Probiotics, Quality of Life, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Treatment Outcome, Vitamins","[{""label"": ""Gastrointestinal Motility"", ""value"": ""Gastrointestinal Motility"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}, {""label"": ""Quality of Life"", ""value"": ""Quality of Life"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Micronutrients"", ""value"": ""Micronutrients"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,L Lombardo,Minerva gastroenterologica e dietologica,2008,"Journal Article, Review","

Patients are increasingly using cannabis and cannabinoids to control abdominal pain. Cannabis acts on receptors of the endocannabinoid system, an endogenous system of lipid mediators that regulates gastrointestinal function and pain processing pathways in health and disease. The endocannabinoid system represents a logical molecular therapeutic target for the treatment of pain in irritable bowel syndrome. Here, we review the physiological and pathophysiological functions of the endocannabinoid system with a focus on the peripheral and central regulation of gastrointestinal function and visceral nociception.

Current studies on the effect of regular coffee consumption on the risk of developing IBS symptoms have yielded conflicting results. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine whether coffee intake is associated with developing IBS. A systematic literature search was performed in three electronic databases, namely PubMed, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library, from inception until 31 March 2023. All original studies reporting associations between coffee intake and IBS were considered for inclusion. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for each study, and estimates were pooled, and where appropriate, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and <i>p</i>-values were calculated. Eight studies comprising 432,022 patients were included in the final meta-analysis. Using a fixed-effects model, coffee drinkers (any intake) had a reduced likelihood of developing IBS compared to controls, with a pooled OR of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.80 to 0.84). Sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of the estimates.

The aim of this study was to confirm the antibacterial activity of an extract of Berberis heteropoda Schrenk rootin vitro and its therapeutic effects on rats with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS) in vivo, as well as to identify the related signaling pathways. A water extract of Berberis heteropoda Schrenk root (BHS) inhibited the growth of S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. faecalis. BHS potentially damaged the structure of the bacterial cell membrane and decreased the activity of some membranous enzymes, eventually killing the S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. faecalis bacteria. Oral administration of BHS (low, middle and high dose group, L, M and H) significantly alleviated the abdominal pain, diarrhea, and depression-like symptoms of D-IBS rats, and the efficacy index ranged from 30% to 60%, indicating that the BHS treatment was effective. BHS (L, M and H) alleviated the abnormal pathological changes in the brain, as evidenced by HE staining. The expression of CHAT, 5-HT, C-FOS and CGRP was reduced by the BHS treatment (L, M and H). Our findings provide novel insights into the use of the natural product BHS to inhibit pathogenic bacteria by destroying the bacterial structure, indicating that BHS possesses certain biological activities. Furthermore, BHS has the potential to alleviate diarrhea, abdominal pain and depression-like behaviors in D-IBS rats by regulating the brain-gut peptide levels.","Animals, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Bacteria, Bacterial Infections, Berberis, Diarrhea, Drugs, Chinese Herbal, Female, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Male, Plant Roots, Rats, Rats, Wistar","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Diarrhea"", ""value"": ""Diarrhea"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Biological Products"", ""value"": ""Biological Products"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"Li Li, Hui-Min Zhu, Qi Yan, Song-Ya Li, Fei Li",Chinese journal of natural medicines,2020,Journal Article,"

It has a unique function in the treatment of gastrointestinal dysfunction including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), is a common functional bowel disease. Its main symptoms are recurrent abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation or alternations between diarrhea and constipation. There are obvious differences in metabolites between TCM syndromes. By comparing the body fluid metabolism maps of model animals, metabolomics can discover disease biomarkers, analyze the differences in metabolic pathways and understand the pathological process and the metabolic pathways of substances in the body. Thus, the evaluation of animal models tends to be comprehensive and objective.

A normal, non-IBS group was established. The rats were treated for 2 wk. On days 0 and 14 of the experimental model, urine was collected for 12 h and was analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.

In the present study, we assessed the effects of <i>Chrysanthellum americanum</i> polyphenolic extract in the psychological stress-induced rat model of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a chronic functional digestive tract disorder marked by immune and inflammatory-related disturbances of central nervous and peripheral intestinal systems, which is often associated with mood disorders including depression and anxiety. Consequently, memory impairment, anxiety and depression behavioral indicators, and cerebral oxidative stress biomarker dynamics were evaluated in a multifactorial heterotypic stress-exposed IBS rats after 6-day gavage with polyphenolic <i>C. americanum</i> extract (100‚Äâmg/kg body weight). Y-maze, elevated plus maze, and forced swimming tests were used for assessing behavioral responses. Administration of the extract exhibited significant anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects coupled with significantly increased temporal lobe antioxidant enzyme specific activity (superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase) and decreased malondialdehyde levels, a well-known lipid peroxidation marker. Furthermore, linear regression statistical analyses showed significant correlations between the oxidative stress parameters and behavioral tests. In conclusion, our results suggest that the administration of <i>Chrysanthellum americanum</i> polyphenolic extract could ameliorate mood and cognitive disturbances related to stress-induced in an IBS rat model.

Blood samples were collected to determine menthol glucuronide concentrations.</p><p><b>RESULTS</b>:<br>Eight healthy volunteers (50% female, median age 22) were included. The time to reach the maximum concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) of IC-PO was significantly longer compared to SI-PO with a median (IQR) of 360 (360-405) versus 180 (120-180)¬†min. The lag time (T<sub>lag</sub>) was significantly longer with a median (IQR) of 225 (204-284) for IC-PO compared to 37 (6-65)¬†min for SI-PO. The areas under the menthol glucuronide plasma concentration-time curves were significantly smaller with a median (IQR) of 2331¬†Œºg¬†h/L (2006-2510) for IC-PO compared to 2623¬†Œºg¬†h/L (2471-2920) for SI-PO. No significant differences were found in peak concentrations and elimination half-lives.</p><p><b>CONCLUSION</b>:<br>IC-PO has a significantly delayed peak menthol glucuronide concentration and T<sub>lag</sub>, both pointing to the release of PO in the more distal part of the intestine. This may enhance therapeutic efficacy as it results in increased exposure of colonic mucosal afferents to the PO.

Due to the limitations of conventional treatments, alternative IBS treatments are used by many patients worldwide. Samryungbaekchulsan (SRS), a herbal formula, has long been used for alleviating diarrhoea-predominant IBS (D-IBS) in traditional Korean medicine. Otilonium bromide (OB) is an antimuscarinic compound used to relieve spasmodic pain in the gut, especially in IBS. Although herbal formulae and Western drugs are commonly coadministered for various diseases in Korea, few clinical studies have been conducted regarding the synergic effects of these treatments for any disease, including D-IBS.</p><p><b>METHODS AND ANALYSIS</b>:<br>This trial is a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, double-dummy, four-arm, parallel study.

Post-treatment follow-up will be conducted 4 weeks after the end of treatment. The primary outcome is the finding obtained using the Subject's Global Assessment of Relief method.

Currently, there is no evidence of obvious anatomic or physiologic abnormalities on the routine diagnostic examinations. There are multiple pathological factors involved in IBS responsible for its heterogeneous nature, although the exact etiology and pathology of IBS are not well known and it is disappointed to develop biomarkers for this disorder. These factors including low-grade inflammation, activation of immune system, changed intestinal microorganism, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), malabsorption of bile acid (BA), increased number of mast cells (MCs). Current pharmacologic treatment for IBS focuses on alleviation of its symptoms, but not on the elimination of its cause. Although there are a lot of conventional chemical medicines for IBS available, due to the limited clinical benefits, high medical expenses and severe side effects, many IBS patients have turned to alternative medicine, particularly Chinese herbal medicine (CHM). Chinese herbal therapies have been used for thousand years in eastern Asia and have been provided that they are effective in relieving symptoms among IBS patients. Generally, traditional Chinese herbal formulae (CHF) consisting of CHM can be easily adjusted in accordance with concrete conditions, which means the treatment is based on syndrome differentiation and varied from individual to individual.

Nonetheless, administration of placebo in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and in clinical settings has been demonstrated to have significant impact on many physical and psychological complaints. Until recently, conventional wisdom has suggested that patients must believe that placebo pills actually contain (or, at least, might possibly contain) active medication in order to elicit a response to placebo. However, several recent RCTs, including patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), chronic low back pain, and episodic migraine, have demonstrated that individuals receiving open-label placebo (OLP) can still experience symptomatic improvement and benefit from honestly described placebo treatment.</p><p><b>METHODS AND DESIGN</b>:<br>This paper describes an innovative multidisciplinary trial design (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ280) that attempts to replicate and expand upon an earlier IBS OLP study.

The study also examines possible genetic and psychological predictors of OLP and seeks to better understand participants' experiences with OLP and DBP through a series of extensive interviews with a randomly selected subgroup.</p><p><b>DISCUSSION</b>:<br>OLP treatment is a novel strategy for ethically harnessing placebo effects. It has potential to re-frame theories of placebo and to influence how physicians can optimize watch-and-wait strategies for common, subjective symptoms.

To assess the effects of Wasabia koreana (WK) on IBS, we employed a mouse model of colonic zymosan injection presenting with diarrhea-predominant IBS-like symptoms. Oral WK administration significantly diminished stool score, suppressed colon length and weight change, and minimized body weight loss without affecting food intake. In WK-treated mice, the submucosal thickening and epithelial lining of the colon were inhibited and were similar to those of na√Øve mice. Infiltration of mast cells into the colon and serum tumor necrosis factor-Œ± levels were markedly suppressed. These effects were comparable to those of sulfasalazine, an anti-inflammatory drug. Furthermore, the number of visceral pain-related behaviors was significantly decreased, and locomotion activities measured in the elevated plus maze and open field tests were significantly increased by WK in a dose-dependent manner compared with amitriptyline, an antidepressant. These changes were accompanied by reduced FosB2 expression in the brain.

Patients need proper assessment and explanation of IBS pathophysiology and appropriate therapies. A low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) diet effectively reduces symptoms in 75% of patients. Best treatment for those nonresponsive will depend on the pathophysiological basis for symptom genesis, with the following possible abnormalities: (i) Visceral hypersensitivity and/or enhanced gut-brain communication: a low FODMAP diet is mainly targeted for this patient group. A dietitian may also recommend antispasmodic agents, including peppermint oil. Another dietary treatment is a low food chemical diet, although this diet is often extremely limited, and therefore, not suited for some populations. Psychological therapies are also clinically beneficial. (ii) Altered motility: in patients with fast transit, a dietitian may recommend a reduction in all FODMAPs or targeted monosaccharides and disaccharides, which are more osmotic in nature. If not effective, patients may benefit from psyllium, which has an exceptional water-holding capacity aimed to promote more formed stools. Patients with slow or uncoordinated transit are often more difficult to treat. Dietary interventions have some success and usually comprise a combination of adequate fiber and fluid, osmotic laxatives, and stimulating agents such as caffeine, senna, and exercise. (iii) Altered microbiome: supplementary probiotics and prebiotics have weak evidence of efficacy with some notable exceptions. A dietitian may trial supplementary Bifidobacterium infantis or oligosaccharides, usually as an adjunct therapy.

The objective of this study is to characterize the effect of C. zacatechichi extracts in mouse models mimicking the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Powdered C. zacatechichi herb (leaves, stems, and flowers) was extracted with methanol. Methanolic extract was filtered and evaporated giving methanolic fraction. The residue was extracted with dichloromethane (DCM). Methanolic and DCM (200¬†mg/kg, per os) extracts were screened for their effect on GI motility in several in vitro tests, and the antidiarrheal and antinociceptive effects were assessed using mouse models. The influence of the DCM extract on motoric parameters and exploratory behaviors was also assessed. Finally, the composition of C. zacatechichi DCM extract was qualitatively analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method.

Treatment approaches are mainly focused on symptom management to maintain everyday functioning and to improve quality of life for patients with IBS.

Due to the lack of scientific evidence in the past, TCM formulas were not internationally well recognized as promising IBS remedies. In this review, firstly, we present the etiology and therapy of IBS in terms of traditional Chinese medical theory. Secondly, we summarize the clinical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of TCM formulas for IBS patients that are available in the literature (from 1998 to September 2013), in which 14 RCTs conducted of high quality were discussed in detail. Of the 14 selected trials, 12 of those concluded that TCM formulas provided superior improvement in the global symptoms of IBS patients over the placebo or conventional medicines. As well, all 14 RCTs suggested that TCM formulas have good safety and tolerability. Last but not least, we explore the pharmacological mechanisms of the anti-IBS TCM formulas available in the literature (from 1994 to September, 2013). Collectively, in combating IBS symptoms, most TCM formulas exert multi-targeting actions including the regulation of neurotransmitters and hormones in the enteric nervous system (ENS), modulation of smooth muscle motility in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, attenuation of intestinal inflammation and restoration of intestinal flora, etc. In conclusion, TCM formulas appear to be promising for IBS treatment.

The diagnosis of IBS is mainly based on exclusion of other intestinal conditions through the absence of inflammatory markers and specific antigens. The current pharmacological treatment approaches available focus on reducing symptom severity while often limiting quality of life because of significant side effects. This has led to an effectiveness gap for IBS patients that seek further relief to increase their quality of life. Complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) have been associated with a higher degree of symptom management and quality of life in IBS patients. Over the past decade, a number of important clinical trials have shown that specific herbal therapies (peppermint oil and Iberogast(¬Æ)), hypnotherapy, cognitive behavior therapy, acupuncture, and yoga present with improved treatment outcomes in IBS patients. We propose an integrative approach to treating the diverse symptoms of IBS by combining the benefits of and need for pharmacotherapy with known CAM therapies to provide IBS patients with the best treatment outcome achievable. Initial steps in this direction are already being considered with an increasing number of practitioners recommending CAM therapies to their patients if pharmacotherapy alone does not alleviate symptoms sufficiently.","Acupuncture Therapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Complementary Therapies, Humans, Hypnosis, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Phytotherapy, Plant Preparations, Treatment Outcome, Yoga","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Biological Products"", ""value"": ""Biological Products"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",2014-Jan-14,"Oliver Grundmann, Saunjoo L Yoon",World journal of gastroenterology,2014,"Journal Article, Review","

The present study investigated the impact zingerone in ameliorating chronic water stress induced irritable bowel disorder, brain gut axis dysfunction and dysregulation of the intestinal barrier due to oxidative stress. Rats were randomly allocated to groups and subjected to chronic water stress for a period of 21 days for 1h and the fecal pellet output was measured. At the end of chronic stress, behavioral assessment for anxiety like behavior was recorded and plasma corticosterone levels were measured 60min after water stress. The colonic transit was determined, levels of oxidative and antioxidant biomarkers were measured in the colon homogenate. Myeloperoxidase activity was determined as an indirect index of neutrophil infiltration. Chronic water stress increased the rate of colonic transit, fecal output, induced behavioral changes, and decreased antioxidant levels. An increase in lipid peroxide levels, catalase and corticosterone was observed. Mast cell infiltration was evident in the stressed group. Zingerone significantly reduced colonic transit, fecal output, neutrophil infiltration, and lipid peroxide formation. The levels of catalase were not altered; however, a marginal increase in the levels of glutathione peroxidase was observed. Zingerone significantly enhanced the levels of superoxide dismutase, glutathione and decreased the levels of corticosterone. Zingerone produced marked improvement in stress induced irritable bowel disorder which could be attributed to the powerful antioxidant nature, direct effect on the intestinal smooth muscle and adaptogenic nature.","Animals, Body Weight, Colon, Corticosterone, Drug Evaluation, Preclinical, Gastrointestinal Transit, Ginger, Guaiacol, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Male, Maze Learning, Oxidative Stress, Phytotherapy, Plant Extracts, Random Allocation, Rats, Wistar","[{""label"": ""Colon"", ""value"": ""Colon"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Biological Products"", ""value"": ""Biological Products"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",2014-Mar-15,"David Banji, Otilia J F Banji, Bandlapalli Pavani, Ch Kranthi Kumar, A R Annamalai",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2014,Journal Article,"

However, there still lack the reasonable and all-round analytical approach and the scientific studies on its underlying mechanisms. Therefore, our study aimed to develop the novel method for evaluating its quality as well as to interpret the potential mechanisms. In our study, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprint was applied to provide a chemical profile of KT. The neonatal maternal separation (NMS) on Sprague-Dawley pups was employed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of KT by virtue of various parameters including visceral hyperalgesia, serum nitric oxide (NO) level, and tissue 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) level. Consequently, a chromatographic condition, which was carried at 30¬∞C with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min on AQUA 3Œº C18 column with mobile phase of acetonitrile and water-phosphoric acid (100:0.1, v/v), was established to give a common fingerprint chromatography under 254 nm with a similarity index of 0.963 within ten batches of KT samples. On the NMS model, KT markedly elevated the pain threshold of NMS rats. Furthermore, KT at three doses significantly decreased 5-HT content from distal colon of visceral hyperalgesia rats induced by NMS, while the significant decrease of 5-HT content in serum was only observed in the group with KT at high dose. However, compared with that in NMS rats without KT, there was no apparent difference of 5-HT level from brain issue in the rats with various doses. Besides, KT could substantially elevate the concentration of NO in the serum. The results showed our study developed the simple, rapid, accurate, reproducible qualitative and quantitative analysis by HPLC fingerprint for the quality control for KT. Data from the pharmacological investigation suggested that the curative effect of KT to the visceral hypersensitivity may be concerned with the level of 5-HT and NO in vivo, promising its potential in irritable bowel syndrome treatment.","Animals, Animals, Newborn, Brain, Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid, Colon, Disease Models, Animal, Drug Evaluation, Preclinical, Drugs, Chinese Herbal, Female, Hyperalgesia, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Maternal Deprivation, Nitric Oxide, Phytotherapy, Rats, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, Serotonin","[{""label"": ""Colon"", ""value"": ""Colon"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Biological Products"", ""value"": ""Biological Products"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",2013-Feb-15,"Yun-Long Chen, Xiao-Qi Huang, Shi-Jie Xu, Jin-Bin Liao, Ru-Jun Wang, Xiao-Feng Lu, You-Liang Xie, Fu-Sheng Zhou, Zi-Ren Su, Xiao-Ping Lai",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2013,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","

This study evaluated the effect of Schisandra chinensis on visceral hyperalgesia induced by neonatal maternal separation (NMS) in an IBS rat model. The visceromotor responses to colorectal balloon distension (CRD) were measured by abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) and electromyographic (EMG) activities. NMS control rats (receiving vehicle) underwent aggravated visceral pain in response to CRD as compared to normal rats, evidenced by the reduced pain threshold, enhanced AWR scores and EMG responses. Treatment with a 70% ethanol extract of S. chinensis (0.3g/kg and 1.5g/kg/day) for 7 days resulted in an increase in the pain threshold (NMS control: 19.1¬±1.0mmHg vs low-dose: 24.8¬±1.3mmHg and high-dose: 25.2¬±1.8mmHg, p&lt;0.01), and abolished the elevated AWR and EMG responses to CRD in NMS rats (AUC values of EMG response curve were: 1952¬±202 in NMS control group vs 1074¬±90 in low-dose group and 1145¬±92 in high-dose group, p&lt;0.001), indicating that S. chinensis could reverse the visceral hypersensitivity induced by early-life stress event. The result of ELSA measurement shows that the elevated serotonin (5-HT) level in the distal colon of NMS rats returned to normal level after treatment with S. chinensis. Moreover, the increase in pain threshold in rats treated with S. chinensis was associated with a decline of the mRNA level of 5-HT(3) receptor in the distal colon.

In spite of their elevated risk for vaccine-preventable disease, vaccination coverage in IMID patients is surprisingly low. This review summarizes current literature data on vaccine safety and efficacy in IMID patients treated with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs and formulates best-practice recommendations on vaccination in this population. Especially in the current era of biological therapies, including TNF-blocking agents, special consideration should be given to vaccination strategies in IMID patients. Clinical evidence indicates that immunization of IMID patients does not increase clinical or laboratory parameters of disease activity. Live vaccines are contraindicated in immunocompromized individuals, but non-live vaccines can safely be given. Although the reduced quality of the immune response in patients under immunotherapy may have a negative impact on vaccination efficacy in this population, adequate humoral response to vaccination in IMID patients has been demonstrated for hepatitis B, influenza and pneumococcal vaccination. Vaccination status is best checked and updated before the start of immunomodulatory therapy: live vaccines are not contraindicated at that time and inactivated vaccines elicit an optimal immune response in immunocompetent individuals.","Humans, Immunization Schedule, Immunocompromised Host, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Psoriasis, Risk Factors, Vaccination, Vaccines","[{""label"": ""Risk Factors"", ""value"": ""Risk Factors"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Biological Products"", ""value"": ""Biological Products"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"Jean-Fran√ßois Rahier, Michel Moutschen, Alfons Van Gompel, Marc Van Ranst, Edouard Louis, Siegfried Segaert, Pierre Masson, Filip De Keyser","Rheumatology (Oxford, England)",2010,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review","

Even when patients have recurrent symptoms, serious disorders are no more frequent in these patients than in the general population, unless other manifestations, anaemia, or an inflammatory syndrome is also present; (2) There is currently no way of radically modifying the natural course of recurrent irritable bowel syndrome; (3) The effects of antispasmodics on abdominal pain have been tested in about 20 randomised controlled trials. Pinaverium and peppermint essential oil have the best-documented efficacy and only moderate adverse effects. Antispasmodics with marked atropinic effects do not have a favourable risk-benefit balance; (4) Tricylic antidepressants seem to have only modest analgesic effects in this setting. In contrast, their adverse effects are frequent and they have somewhat negative risk-benefit balances. Nor has the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants (SSRIs) been demonstrated; (5) Alosetron and tegaserod carry a risk of potentially life-threatening adverse effects and therefore have negative risk-benefit balances; (6) Seeds of plants such as psyllium and ispaghul, as well as raw apples and pears, have a limited impact on constipation and pain. Osmotic laxatives are effective on constipation. Symptomatic treatments for constipation can sometimes aggravate abdominal discomfort; (7) Loperamide has been poorly assessed in patients with recurrent irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea. It modestly slows bowel movement but does not relieve pain or abdominal discomfort; (8) Dietary measures have not been tested in comparative trials. Some patients are convinced that certain foods provoke a recurrence of irritable bowel syndrome, but restrictive diets carry a risk of nutritional deficiencies; (9) Various techniques intended to control emotional and psychological disturbances have been proposed, including relaxation, biofeedback, hypnosis, and psychotherapy. The results of clinical trials are not convincing; (10) Oral products containing live bacteria, designed to change the equilibrium of intestinal flora, have been tested in 13 placebo-controlled trials, with inconsistent results. A few cases of septicaemia have been reported; (11) The six available trials of acupuncture (versus sham acupuncture) showed no more than a placebo effect; (12) In practice, patients who have recurrent irritable bowel syndrome but with no other signs of a condition warranting specific treatment should be reassured as to the harmless nature of their disorder if a careful physical examination and basic laboratory tests are negative. The only available treatments have purely symptomatic effects and only limited efficacy.

Studies suggest that IBS symptoms in one quarter of patients may be caused or exacerbated by one or more dietary components. Recent studies indicate that a diet restricted in fermentable, poorly absorbed carbohydrates, including fructose, fructans (present in wheat and onions), sorbitol, and other sugar alcohols is beneficial, but confirmatory studies are needed. Despite a long history of enthusiastic use, fiber is marginally beneficial. Insoluble fiber may worsen symptoms. Some patients with IBS, especially those with constipation, will improve with increased intake of soluble fiber. Prebiotic fibers have not been adequately tested. Daily use of peppermint oil is effective in relieving IBS symptoms. The usefulness of probiotics in the form of foods such as live-culture yogurt and buttermilk for IBS symptoms is not established. In clinical practice, it is very difficult to establish that a patient's symptoms result from an adverse reaction to food. A double blind placebo-controlled food challenge is the most reliable method, but it is not suitable for routine clinical use. A modified exclusion diet and stepwise reintroduction of foods or trials of eliminating classes of food may be useful.","Constipation, Diet, Dietary Fiber, Fermentation, Food Hypersensitivity, Fructose Intolerance, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Lactose Intolerance, Mentha piperita, Plant Oils, Probiotics, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Sorbitol","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Constipation"", ""value"": ""Constipation"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Biological Products"", ""value"": ""Biological Products"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"William D Heizer, Susannah Southern, Susan McGovern",Journal of the American Dietetic Association,2009,"Journal Article, Review","

Accordingly, recommended management is to develop a logical strategy including a positive diagnosis, consideration of the patient's agenda and emotional state, critical appraisal of the efficacies of various drugs and a graded therapeutic response. Unfortunately, none of the currently available drugs (e.g. antispasmodics, antidiarrheals, osmotics, cathartics, bulking agents, tranquilizers, sedatives) are globally effective in treating all IBS symptoms, and the advanced receptor-targeted drugs are not always successfully and safely marketed. Consequently, more than half of patients may seek complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to treat the annoying bowel symptoms. Physicians have considered these CAM measures to have an ""enhanced placebo effect"". For example, many herbal medicine and plant products are globally used to treat IBS, whereas their efficacies are often inconclusive because of small sample sizes, inadequate data analyses and lack of standardized preparations. Meta-analyses do not establish their true efficacy. Acupuncture has long been employed by patients themselves to treat functional gastrointestinal disorders with satisfactory response, but its effect on IBS does not seem to be promising. Peppermint oil, melatonin and clay-like materials are effective in treating some IBS symptoms, while their true pharmacology remains enigmatic. In conclusion, IBS treatment is usually tailored to the individual's manifestations, ranging from reassurance to psychotherapy.

It is now believed that disordered gut function (including abnormalities like disturbances of motility such as postprandial fundic relaxation, gastric emptying and disturbed visceral sensory function) play a key role for the manifestation of these disorders. The underlying pathophysiology is not yet fully understood. However, the available data suggest that a number of factors may contribute to the manifestation of symptoms. These factors include environmental factors such as acute infections as trigger event, psychological stressors that may precede acute exacerbations and a genetic predisposition. Considering the large number of mechanisms, a treatment targeting a single mechanism is unlikely to be effective in all patients. Indeed, chemically defined treatments usually gain a 10-15% superiority over placebo. In recent years placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated superiority of a commercial multicomponent herbal preparation, STW 5, with the trade name Iberogast, for the treatment of patients with functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome. This phytopharmacon is a combination of nine plant extracts each with a number of different active constituents. Pharmacological studies have shown different effects of the single plant extracts on the (molecular) mechanisms which are discussed as underlying the manifestation of symptoms. Various well-controlled clinical trials have independently confirmed clinical efficacy and safety. The clinically efficacy of this multicomponent herbal preparation questions the current trend of highly targeted drug molecules that usually target one single receptor population while it has not been shown that a single receptor group plays a pivotal role for the control of symptoms. Herbal medicines are obtained from various plants and contain complex extracts with a large number of different active substances. While there are only limited head-to-head comparisons with conventional chemically defined medications, the combination of extracts with various gastrointestinal active ingredients appears to be advantageous for a heterogeneous condition such as functional dyspepsia.","Antiemetics, Cisapride, Cohort Studies, Double-Blind Method, Dyspepsia, Gastrointestinal Agents, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Meta-Analysis as Topic, Metoclopramide, Pain, Pharmacoepidemiology, Phytotherapy, Plant Extracts, Product Surveillance, Postmarketing, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Biological Products"", ""value"": ""Biological Products"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"W R√∂sch, T Liebregts, K-J Gundermann, B Vinson, G Holtmann",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2006,"Journal Article, Review","

We also investigated whether intracolonic OM-induced inflammation alters gastrointestinal (GI) function over a longer time frame as a model of postinflammatory irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS). Mice given a single administration of 0.5% OM developed a severe colitis that peaked at day 3, was reduced at day 7, and was absent by day 14. At the peak response, there was body weight loss, colon shrinkage, thickening and weight increases, distension of the proximal colon, and diarrhea. Macroscopic inspection of the distal colon revealed a discontinuous pattern of inflammatory damage and occasional transmural ulceration. Histological examination showed loss of epithelium, an inflammatory infiltrate, destruction of mucosal architecture, edema, and loss of circular smooth muscle architecture. OM administration increased transit of a carmine dye bolus from 58% of the total length of the upper GI tract in untreated age-matched controls to as high as 74% when tested at day 28 post-OM. Mice in the latter group demonstrated a significantly more sensitive response to inhibition of upper GI transit by the mu-opioid receptor agonist loperamide compared with normal mice.

Other studies suggest that abnormalities of specific gut function are linked to manifestation of symptoms. These abnormalities include disturbances of motility such as postprandial fundic relaxation, gastric emptying and disturbed visceral sensory function. The underlying pathophysiology is not fully understood. However, various studies point towards hereditary (or molecular) factors modified by environmental factors. Considering this broad spectrum of factors it is conceivable that treatments targeting a single mechanism are most likely to improve symptoms only in patients with a disturbance linked to this mechanism. Thus overall efficacy in the whole patient population is limited. Indeed, superiority of chemically defined treatments targeting a single receptor yield a benefit over placebo of between 10 and 15%. In recent years well-controlled studies have demonstrated superiority of specific herbal preparations. This in particular held true for combinations of various plant extracts or herbal extracts with a number of different active ingredients. However, efficacy of herbal treatment for functional GI disorders cannot be taken for granted and these drugs need to be rigorously tested for efficacy and safety. In this context, same standards apply as for conventional chemically defined medications.","Dyspepsia, Evidence-Based Medicine, Gastrointestinal Motility, Gastrointestinal Transit, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Parasympatholytics, Phytotherapy, Plant Extracts, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Treatment Outcome","[{""label"": ""Gastrointestinal Motility"", ""value"": ""Gastrointestinal Motility"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""None provided"", ""value"": ""None provided"", ""color"": ""#c8c8c8"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#c8c8c8; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]","[{""label"": ""Biological Products"", ""value"": ""Biological Products"", ""color"": ""#bdccf9"", ""text_color"": ""#101517"", ""style"": ""--tag-bg:#bdccf9; --tag-text-color:#101517; --tag-remove-btn-color: #101517;""}]",None provided,"Gerald Holtmann, Birgit Adam, Bettina Vinson",Wiener medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),2004,"English Abstract, Journal Article, Review","
