# Mandarin-English online dictionary

As a passionate learner of the Chinese language, I decided to build my own online Chinese-English dictionary based on the open-source [CEDICT dataset](https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=cedict). I built this web app using Python Flask. It served as a fun introduction for me in using Python for web development!
