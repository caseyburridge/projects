# Bitcoin Price Lookup

View full website here: https://bitcoinpricelookup.com

I built a website that tracks Bitcoin price data (and other geeky stats, like network hash rate, transaction volume, etc) on a day-by-day basis.

I compiled the dataset using the [Blockchain.com API](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/api/blockchain_api). I imported the data into a WordPress website, creating one new page for every day. The website allows users to look up Bitcoin price and network stats for any day since the network began operating.
